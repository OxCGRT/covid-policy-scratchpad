# Differentiated vaccination policy methodology

***Differentiated methodology version 1.0 <br/>8 March 2022***

The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker), [university website](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker)) tracks individual policy measures across 20 indicators. We also calculate several indices to give an overall impression of government activity, and this page describes how these indices are calculated. Changes to this methodology are recorded in the [changelog](#index-methodology-changelog) below.

This experimental differentiated vaccination policy csv reports four different versions of each index:

|  | Government Response Index | Containment and Health Index | Stringency Index | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Non-Vaccinated | GRI_Nonvax | CHI_Nonvax | SI_Nonvax | 
| Vaccinated | GRI_Vax | CHI_Vax | SI_Vax | 
| Average | GRI_Avg | CHI_Avg | SI_Avg | 
| Proportion population vaccinated | GRI_WeightAvg | CHI_WeightAvg | SI_WeightAvg |
