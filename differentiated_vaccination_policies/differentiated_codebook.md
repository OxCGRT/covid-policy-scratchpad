# Differentiated vaccination policies codebook for the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker

***Codebook version 1.0 <br/>11 March 2022***

This codebook document is an addition to the core [codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md) for the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, and explains the key differences and considerations relevant to the experimental differentiated vaccination policy coding csv ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker), [university website](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker)). 

This document is the temporary/draft codebook for the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (GitHub repo, university website) differentiated vaccination data demo dataset. The dataset contains 21 live indicators, 3 retired fiscal indicators and a miscellaneous notes field and is organised into five groups:

- [C - containment and closure policies](#containment-and-closure-policies)
- [E - economic policies](#economic-policies)
- [H - health system policies](#health-system-policies)
- [V - vaccination policies](#vaccination-policies)
- [M - miscellaneous policies](#miscellaneous-policies)

The following ten indicators are split into separate variables for `non-vaccinated`(NV) people and `vaccinated` (V) people where policies differ between these groups: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, H6 and H8. If there is no differentiated policy in place, we report a single variable for `everyone`(E).
We define differentiated policies to mean policies where vaccinated people can access greater freedoms due to their vaccination status, and are subject to less stringent restrictions. 
For more detailed guidance about the codebook and how we interpret the indicators, see the draft coding interpretation guide. This ensures consistency, and standardizes coding across the database.
Updates to this demo codebook are recorded in the changelog below.
