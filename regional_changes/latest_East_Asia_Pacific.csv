Since October 2020, to enable more activities to resume in a safe manner, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been piloting the use of pre-event testing to reduce the risk of undetected COVID-19 cases being involved in an event. Pre-event testing requires participants of an event or activity to be tested before attending the event and no more than 24 hours before the end of their participation at the event, either at the event venue or at a dedicated testing facility or clinic. Only participants who have a valid negative COVID-19 test result will be allowed to participate in the event. This helps to prevent individuals infected with COVID-19 from transmitting it to other people at the event. We have since conducted pilots of such pre-event testing at selected events across different settings such as business-to-business events, wedding receptions, and live performances. These experiences have helped MOH and the private sector providers to assess the feasibility and operational workflows for implementing pre-event testing in these settings.    13.      From 24 April 2021, the following selected activities will be allowed to scale up further if they implement pre-event testing for their attendees. The respective safe management measures for each activity or sector[3], as well as the safe capacities for each venue, continue to apply (see summary in Annex):    a.    Marriage solemnisations. To facilitate more people coming together to celebrate this key life event, the limit for marriage solemnisations[4] will be increased from 100 to 250 attendees in total (including the wedding couple, excluding the Licensed Solemniser and vendors) for the entire event, in zones of up to 50 attendees each. For solemnisation-only events involving more than 100 attendees, pre-event testing will be required for the wedding couple. If there are 100 or fewer attendees, pre-event testing will not be required.    b.    Wedding receptions. Similarly, the limit for wedding receptions[5] will be increased from 100 attendees to 250 attendees in total (including the wedding couple, excluding vendors) for the entire event, in zones or timeslots of up to 50 attendees each. Due to the higher risk of receptions where people are unmasked while enjoying their meals and come into close and prolonged contact with one another in celebration, pre-event testing for all attendees (including the wedding couple) will be required for wedding receptions involving more than 100 attendees.    c.     Live performances. Live performances at designated venues will be allowed to have up to 750 attendees if they implement pre-event testing, or to have up to 250 attendees if they do not implement pre-event testing. The National Arts Council will release updated guidelines on audience management at live performances subsequently.    d.    Pilot business-to-business events [6]. Currently, business-to-business events being piloted and approved by Singapore Tourism Board (STB) may have up to 250 attendees, in zones of no more than 50 attendees each. If pre-event testing is implemented, these events will be allowed to have up to 750 attendees, in zones of no more than 50 attendees each. STB will release the updated Safe Business Events framework and application details subsequently.    e.    Pilot spectator sports events (seated). Currently, sport events being piloted and approved by SportSG have been allowed to take place. Under this pilot, sport events will be allowed to have up to 750 spectators if they implement pre-event testing, or to have up to 250 spectators without testing. SportSG will release further details on the pilot subsequently.    14.      In addition to the above, from 24 April 2021, to allow more people to bid farewell to loved ones, we will increase the cap for wakes and funerals on the day of the burial/cremation only, from 30 to 50 persons at any one time. The cap for other days of the wake remains at 30 attendees at any one time. Because pre-event testing is not required and there could be a large number of persons visiting over the course of the wake and funeral to pay their last respects, attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of spread.    15.      From 24 April 2021, individuals who have completed the full vaccination regimen and have had time to develop sufficient protection (i.e. two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination) can gain entry to events that implement pre-event testing without the need to undergo pre-event testing.
