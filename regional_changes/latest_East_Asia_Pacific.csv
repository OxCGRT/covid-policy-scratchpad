While mask-wearing has become a controversial and almost political issue in some parts of the world, it is already culturally-engrained in Japan. During flu-season, but also year-round, people often wear masks to try to prevent one's own germs or sickness from spreading in public places. This is seen as particularly important in Japan's densely-populated cities. Aside from health reasons, people also regularly wear masks as a defence against dust and pollen, to cover up blemishes or the fact they are not wearing make-up, and even to make the wearer's face appear smaller! Therefore, while mask-wearing has become a hot topic in other parts of the world, they have undoubtedly become the societal norm since the spread of coronavirus, and many commentators have argued this has helped keep Japan's infection rate low. From our own observations on the ground, it seems at least 90% of people are wearing masks whenever they are outside.

All individuals must also wear face masks and observe safe distancing.  Prayers must be kept to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of cleaning and sanitation before the next prayer session is conducted.    The easing of the restrictions comes three days after Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday that Chinese New Year celebrations would only be allowed among family members from the same household.  ...  Ismail Sabri also previously said that temple prayers would be limited to five members from the temple’s management committee.

See the PNG National Department of Health's Facebook post/media release, archived at https://archive.vn/bfZLR    ""He announced that there are four urban clinics in the NCD that are now doing swabbing for COVID-19 tests for those with symptoms of COVID-19 where members of the public can also get their test results within a short time for free. These are Badili, Tokarara, Morata and Gordons clinics. These sites are part of the nine clinics that have been selected to participate in the Antigen (Ag) Rapid Diagnosis (RDT) validation in NCD. The public will be informed when the rest of the nine clinics begin swabbing too.  Other sites that are also providing routine swabbing for symptomatic clients are Pari clinic in Moresby South, and the Port Moresby General Hospital. The general public are encouraged to utilize any of these services to check for COVID-19 infection.  Mr Manning said that this Antigen test is easy and results will be given within 20 to 30 minutes. Further GeneXpert testing is then performed on positive samples to confirm if the patient has the coronavirus disease or not. The turnaround time is about an hour which is more convenient for isolation and contact tracing.  He also confirmed that Rita Flynn is no longer swabbing but only tests the positive samples it receives from the urban sites to confirm, using GeneXpert. All negative samples from the Ag test are sent to CPHL for confirmation."""

As of 18 February 2021, about 250,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Amongst them, more than 110,000 have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen. Following the successful pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, we will commence COVID-19 vaccinations for seniors in the community from 22 February.    3.    COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. By mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town, all seniors will be able to receive their vaccination. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.    4.    Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.    8.   To ensure that seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations, we will set up more vaccination centres in the coming weeks. Currently, there are 11 vaccination centres in operation[3]. Three more vaccination centres located at community centres/clubs will commence operations by 22 February, at Bukit Timah, Marine Parade and Taman Jurong, bringing the total to 14. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town. In total, there will eventually be around 40 vaccination centres, with each vaccination centre planned for an estimated capacity of 2,000 vaccinations per day.    http://archive.today/2021.02.22-144640/https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/start-of-covid-19-vaccination-for-seniors    Coding note: the code for H7 was previously changed from 1G to 2G on 27th January in response to the pilot vaccination programme for elderly groups at Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar."
