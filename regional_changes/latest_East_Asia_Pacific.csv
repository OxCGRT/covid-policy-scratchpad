""The Ministry of Health and Medical Services also clarifies that a report on the declining low positive cases today is associated with the low number of people visiting clinics for tests yesterday, Sunday 13th of February 2022.  This is also experienced in many countries as clinics normally receive low number of cases on Monday after only a few people come for testing on Sunday.  Moreover, clinics also report that many people are still symptomatic but do not turn up to be tested as they only follow the MHMS guidance to stay at home and monitor their symptoms.    In light of this, the Government appeals to the general public for stronger support and cooperation to assist in mitigating the spread of the virus in the country and encourage them to get tested at clinics to be able to know their status.  With this information, they will be able to protect their loved ones by staying isolated at home and following SOPs until their infectious stage is over.   This will greatly reduce the spread of the virus.""    http://archive.today/2022.02.14-191313/https://www.facebook.com/ob.gov.ki/posts/257856156522930"

Government agencies or other entities may apply for entry approval for foreign essential workers, technical experts, and investors. International entrants must obtain prior permission from Lao authorities at least seven days before arrival; provide a valid entry visa if applicable, a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure, and a completed health declaration form; and download the LaoKYC application. Foreign nationals must also have insurance coverage for COVID-19 treatment and other related expenses from international or local providers.    Authorities allow tourist arrivals from several locations in the first phase of Green Travel Zone international travel reopening scheme through March 31. The locations include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the US, the UK, Thailand, and Vietnam. Travelers must be fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival, have a health insurance policy with a coverage of at least USD 50,000, obtain a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours before departure, undergo an on-arrival PCR test, and remain at their accommodation for 48 hours until they receive a negative result from the on-arrival test.    In the first phase of reopening, officials allow tourists to visit the Green Travel Zones of Vientiane Capital, Luang Prabang Province, and Vang Vieng District of Vientiane Province, as well as the Green Travel Trails of Champasack, Khammouane, Oudomxay, Xayaboury, and Xieng Khouang provinces. Green Travel Zones and Green Travel Trails are areas with vaccination rates of at least 70 percent and below 70 percent respectively. Authorities permit tourists to enter only through Wattay International Airport (VTE) and the First Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge in Vientiane Prefecture. Officials plan to categorize other localities, including Savannakhet Province, as Green Travel Zones and Green Travel Trails areas, and announce additional points of entry in the second phase of reopening from April 1-June 30.    Officials allow some border checkpoints, including those with Thailand, to open. Border checkpoints with China are closed due to the Chinese authorities' COVID-19 concerns.  http://web.archive.org/web/20220228175740/https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2022/02/laos-officials-reduce-quarantine-period-for-most-international-arrivals-to-seven-days-as-of-feb-4-update-42"

(IHL staff are already subject to VDS via MOMâs Workforce Vaccination Measures.) All students will be exempted from VDS. This exemption is subject to review.    To facilitate the safe resumption of in-person activities for IHL students, all unvaccinated students will be required to complete a weekly self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) regime to take part in higher risk activities on campus which require VDS, such as indoor unmasked activities or large-scale student events.

More student activities and large scale student events will resume in line with national guidelines on group sizes and event sizes.""

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community. This has bought time for us to booster vaccinate more residents, learn more about the Omicron variant and make necessary adjustments to our COVID-19 strategy. As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now. We will continue to review the local and global COVID-19 situation and adjust our measures accordingly.    Facilitating Travel for Recently-Recovered Travellers    28.    With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas. See Annex D for the list of documentation to be presented by such travellers at check-in and arrival immigration to qualify for this exemption.""

It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).  Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or operators appointed by NEA will receive a 0.5-month rental waiver.

Individuals will need to bring along their photo identification for verification at the QTC.    Both the CTCs and QTCs are important as they support COVID-19 testing, which helps to keep our homes and communities safe, especially as we re-open and resume our activities.    Click here for the locations of QTCs CTCs.""

Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily through the respiratory droplets of infected people, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. These respiratory droplets can reach the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person directly or indirectly (via contaminated surfaces), resulting in infection.  Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.  To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing. Individuals should also observe good hand hygiene and avoid crowded spaces if possible.""""      Link (1): https://web.archive.org/web/20211206075819/https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/general"

From the 24 of January, all in-persons will be suspended for 4 weeks until 20 February 2022 in light of the current omicron wave in Singapore.  _________________    Quote (1):  ""[Updated 21 January 2022]    To better protect our patients and healthcare workers, particularly in settings with vulnerable persons, in-person visits to all hospital wards1 and residential care homes will be suspended for a period of four weeks, from 24 January to 20 February 2022 (both dates inclusive).    During this period, hospitals and homes can make assessments on a case-by-case basis to allow in-person visits for exceptional cases. More details for visits to hospitals and homes can be found below.    Pre-visit testing requirements at hospitals and homes    Visitors who are allowed into hospital wards and homes will be required to show a valid negative ART result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit. All tests are to be self-funded by the visitor. This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2.   Fully vaccinated or medically ineligible visitors can perform an unsupervised self-administered ART or opt for an ART administered by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres) to fulfil the pre-visit testing requirement. Those who opt to undergo unsupervised self-administered ART will be required to show evidence of a valid ART result, e.g. present a time-stamped photo of the dated ART result and photo ID for verification prior to entry.  Non-fully vaccinated visitors would be required to show results of ART administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including Quick Test Centres). Results from unsupervised self-administered ART will not be accepted for this group of visitors.    In-person visits at hospitals  The following patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospitals:   a. Patients who are in critical condition;    b. Paediatric patients;   c. Birthing/post-partum mothers; and    d. Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples of caregivers include those providing assistance to inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better  care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.      The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patientâs bedside at any one time.  All visitors approved to enter hospital wards must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or use the patientsâ toilets in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ beds.    1Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals   2 Recovered individuals (within last 180 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic  offering ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing services.""
