Originally,  ""The first phase will begin on January 3, 2022.     The minister explained that in-person teaching and learning for secondary students in Year 10 and Year 11 will be conducted five times a week, including special needs students from Priority Level 1 and 2. Whereas those in Priority Level 3 will only have to attend their physical classes once a week.     For Year 12 and 13 students, as well as Priority Level 1 and 2, and special need students will also undergo face-to-face teaching and learning five times a week, while once a week in-person classes for Priority Level 3 students.     âMeanwhile, teaching and learning for the remaining students will be made via online or Home Learning Pack (HLP). The first phase is planned to be carried out for at least two weeks whereby the transition towards the second phase depending if there is no increase in the spread of serious cases of infections among the students, teachers and staff as well as on the advice of the COVID-19 Steering Committeeâ, the minister explained.     The minister shared that the second phase is expected to begin on January 17, 2022. However, its implementation will depend on the current Covid-19 situation as well.     In the second phase, said the minister, in-person lessons will be carried out five times a week for students who have completed two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and the increased school capacity from 40 to 100 per cent. This is to be implemented for secondary school students from Year 7 to 11, including special need students in Priority Level 1 and 2. Those in Priority Level 3 will have to attend their physical classes thrice a week, and Year 12 and 13 students, including special needs in Priority Level 1 and 2. Classes for special needs students in Priority Level 3 will be carried out thrice a week.     Lessons for students aged 5 to 11 who have yet to receive their vaccination will continue via online and HLP.     âStudents who continue to have difficulties with online learning will be continued to be supported by the school through the provision of HLPâ, the minister stated. ""    Additionally, from the first Scoop report,   ""Only fully vaccinated teachers and students can return to primary and secondary schools, sixth form centres and higher education institutions.    Some 98 percent of teachers are fully jabbed while 80 percent of students aged 12-17 have received two vaccine doses, according to education ministry figures.    All double-vaxxed students, teachers and non-teaching staff are still required to undergo antigen rapid tests once a week in the first stage of school reopening.""    â    ""Toddlers aged 3 to 4 can head back to kindergartens from January 17, the education minister said Wednesday.    Joining the COVID-19 news conference, Dato Hj Hamzah Hj Sulaiman said in-person lessons will be allowed for preschoolers five times a week, but attendance at kindergartens is capped at 30 percent.    To ensure the safety of preschoolers who are not authorised to receive the vaccine against COVID, only kindergartens that meet health requirements can reopen.    Kindergarten pupils will also be required to wear face masks and undergo antigen rapid tests once a week, with only those producing negative results permitted to attend in-person classes.    The minister said parents and guardians of the children must be fully jabbed and show proof of vaccination.

Cabinet has agreed to lift all self-isolation requirements for vaccinated travellers entering New Zealand from 11:59pm on Wednesday 2 March 2022. That means New Zealand citizens and other eligible travellers entering the country will be able to step off the plane and immediately connect with family and friends and enjoy all New Zealand has to offer.    Caution has served us well during the past 2 years and as we continue to move through the Omicron outbreak and peak, we will continue to remove restrictions when advised it is safe to do so â as we always said we would.    Now that we are 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk has shifted from our border to our community. As the pandemic evolves, we are too. Getting tested is now quicker and easier, requirements for isolation have been simplified to those who share a household, and care in the community is focused towards those most in need of support.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220215081617/https://covid19.govt.nz/news-and-data/latest-news/new-zealand-border-to-reopen-in-stages-from-27-february/  https://web.archive.org/web/20220321101923/https://covid19.govt.nz/news-and-data/latest-news/self-isolation-requirements-removed-step-2-brought-forward/"

There are presently no plans to introduce VDS in our pre-schools, primary schools or SPED schools with primary/junior section. Our priority now is to ensure our children are well protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.    Similarly, COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for physical attendance in our secondary schools, SPED schools with secondary/senior sections, junior colleges and Millennia Institute. Access to quality education remains MOEâs priority. However, where there are public health reasons to better protect our students participating in higher risk activities, additional measures would be put in place. For example, unvaccinated students are required to perform a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) prior to participating in higher-risk activities such as singing and playing wind instruments. In addition, under the ongoing MCCY-MOE Team Sports Pilot for schools and IHLs, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an on-site ART self-swab are allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10.    From 1 February 2022, VDS will be expanded to include Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For now, VDS will only apply to all visitors who enter the IHLs.

The SMM 1-5 framework consists of five key parameters: (i) group sizes; (ii) mask-wearing; (iii) workplace requirements; (iv) safe distancing; and (v) capacity limits. As the local situation has improved considerably, we will ease the community SMMs along these five parameters.  From 29 March 2022, we will implement the following adjustments (see Annex A for more details):  a.    Group Sizes. The permissible group size for social gatherings will be increased from 5 persons to 10 persons for mask-off activities. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will also be adjusted from 5 persons at any one time, to 10 persons at any one time.  b.    Mask-Wearing. Mask-wearing will continue to be required for indoor settings when people leave their homes, but will be optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas. Indoor places refer to all buildings/places with clearly defined entrances/exits, such as office buildings, shopping malls, public transport (i.e. when commuting in trains and buses), and includes hawker centres and coffeeshops. Places which are sheltered but with open access generally, such as Housing Development Board (HDB) void decks, retail block walkways, bus stops, and naturally ventilated bus interchanges will be regarded as outdoor areas. See Annex B for more examples.  c.     Workplace Requirements. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can now return to the workplace, an increase from the current limit of 50%. We will continue to align the rules for social gatherings in workplaces and other social settings, so long as the general group size and masking rules are adhered to.  d.    Safe Distancing. Safe distancing continues to be encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups for mask-on settings. A safe distance of 1 metre will continue to be required for mask-off settings. between individuals or between groups up to the prevailing group size limit. Notwithstanding this, we still need to guard against gatherings of big crowds, even if they have their masks on. Hence, we will continue to impose capacity limits, as described below.  e.    Capacity Limits. The capacity limit of 50% for large events and settings of more than 1,000 pax1 will be increased to 75%. This means that:    i.     For smaller settings/events with =1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit.   ii.     For larger settings/events with >1,000 pax and that are mask-on2, they will be subject to operating within 75% of the capacity limit of the venue. For mask-off events, individuals or groups of individuals up to the prevailing group size will be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement.    Other Activity-Specific Adjustments  7.             In line with the above easing under the SMM 1-5 framework, we will also make the following activity-specific adjustments from 29 March 2022.  8.             Dine-in at food and beverage (F&B) establishments. In line with the increase in group size, groups of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops, where full vaccination-differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks have been implemented at their entrances. To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, we will allow all F&B establishments to seat smaller groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons, without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance. Instead, random spot-checks will be done to ensure that only vaccinated persons are dining-in at these places, and the onus will be on the dining-in individuals to abide by the rules. This will make it easier for the F&B operators who face difficulties in cordoning off their venues and setting up discrete access control points especially hawker centres and coffee-shops.  9.             Alcohol consumption. The current restriction, in F&B establishments, on the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm will be lifted.  10.          Live performances and screening of programmes. Live performances will be allowed to resume at all venues, including F&B establishments. Outdoor live performances and busking3 will also be allowed to resume.  Groups that are involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing SMM 1-5, i.e. keep to the group size of 10 unmasked persons. We will also lift the restriction on the screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments.  11.          Vocalisation activities. We had previously taken a strong position against group vocalisation activities because of the higher risk of transmission. But we are now in a different situation and can start easing this restriction. Subject to masks being worn throughout the vocalisation activity, we will allow the following activities which involve vocalisation by large groups:  a.    Congregational singing and chanting;  b.    Cheering by audiences/spectators/participants at events; and  c.     Singing in general settings, including in schools.  12.          Social events and larger-scale social gatherings. Except for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions, which are key life events, we have held back from allowing larger-scale social gatherings and events such as gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events (D&Ds), birthday celebrations and anniversaries.  Given the stabilising local situation and for consistency with other events, we will allow such social events and gatherings to resume. Organisers of these events should still comply the prevailing SMM 1-5. That means there should be no more than 10 persons per table, and safe distancing of 1 m maintained between tables. Participants should also continue to exercise prudence and restraint, and limit their interactions to the same group they are seated with.  13.          The above changes will all take effect from 29 March 2022. The relevant agencies will provide more details on any further detailed requirements specific to their sectors.  14.          We are separately looking into the safe resumption of nightlife businesses, comprising bars, pubs, karaoke establishments, discotheques and nightclubs. These are activities with much higher risks of transmission and where there are generally more difficulties complying with the prevailing SMM 1-5. MTI and MHA will provide an update on the re-opening of the sector in the coming weeks.""

Cheering by audiences/spectators/participants at events; and  c.     Singing in general settings, including in schools.  12.          Social events and larger-scale social gatherings. Except for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions, which are key life events, we have held back from allowing larger-scale social gatherings and events such as gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events (D&Ds), birthday celebrations and anniversaries.  Given the stabilising local situation and for consistency with other events, we will allow such social events and gatherings to resume. Organisers of these events should still comply the prevailing SMM 1-5. That means there should be no more than 10 persons per table, and safe distancing of 1 m maintained between tables. Participants should also continue to exercise prudence and restraint, and limit their interactions to the same group they are seated with.  13.          The above changes will all take effect from 29 March 2022. The relevant agencies will provide more details on any further detailed requirements specific to their sectors.  14.          We are separately looking into the safe resumption of nightlife businesses, comprising bars, pubs, karaoke establishments, discotheques and nightclubs. These are activities with much higher risks of transmission and where there are generally more difficulties complying with the prevailing SMM 1-5. MTI and MHA will provide an update on the re-opening of the sector in the coming weeks.""

The SMM 1-5 framework consists of five key parameters: (i) group sizes; (ii) mask-wearing; (iii) workplace requirements; (iv) safe distancing; and (v) capacity limits. As the local situation has improved considerably, we will ease the community SMMs along these five parameters.  From 29 March 2022, we will implement the following adjustments (see Annex A for more details):  a.    Group Sizes. The permissible group size for social gatherings will be increased from 5 persons to 10 persons for mask-off activities. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will also be adjusted from 5 persons at any one time, to 10 persons at any one time.  b.    Mask-Wearing. Mask-wearing will continue to be required for indoor settings when people leave their homes, but will be optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas. Indoor places refer to all buildings/places with clearly defined entrances/exits, such as office buildings, shopping malls, public transport (i.e. when commuting in trains and buses), and includes hawker centres and coffeeshops. Places which are sheltered but with open access generally, such as Housing Development Board (HDB) void decks, retail block walkways, bus stops, and naturally ventilated bus interchanges will be regarded as outdoor areas. See Annex B for more examples.  c.     Workplace Requirements. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can now return to the workplace, an increase from the current limit of 50%. We will continue to align the rules for social gatherings in workplaces and other social settings, so long as the general group size and masking rules are adhered to.  d.    Safe Distancing. Safe distancing continues to be encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups for mask-on settings. A safe distance of 1 metre will continue to be required for mask-off settings. between individuals or between groups up to the prevailing group size limit. Notwithstanding this, we still need to guard against gatherings of big crowds, even if they have their masks on. Hence, we will continue to impose capacity limits, as described below.  e.    Capacity Limits. The capacity limit of 50% for large events and settings of more than 1,000 pax1 will be increased to 75%. This means that:    i.     For smaller settings/events with =1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit.   ii.     For larger settings/events with >1,000 pax and that are mask-on2, they will be subject to operating within 75% of the capacity limit of the venue. For mask-off events, individuals or groups of individuals up to the prevailing group size will be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement.    Other Activity-Specific Adjustments  7.             In line with the above easing under the SMM 1-5 framework, we will also make the following activity-specific adjustments from 29 March 2022.  8.             Dine-in at food and beverage (F&B) establishments. In line with the increase in group size, groups of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops, where full vaccination-differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks have been implemented at their entrances. To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, we will allow all F&B establishments to seat smaller groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons, without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance. Instead, random spot-checks will be done to ensure that only vaccinated persons are dining-in at these places, and the onus will be on the dining-in individuals to abide by the rules. This will make it easier for the F&B operators who face difficulties in cordoning off their venues and setting up discrete access control points especially hawker centres and coffee-shops.  9.             Alcohol consumption. The current restriction, in F&B establishments, on the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm will be lifted.  10.          Live performances and screening of programmes. Live performances will be allowed to resume at all venues, including F&B establishments. Outdoor live performances and busking3 will also be allowed to resume.  Groups that are involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing SMM 1-5, i.e. keep to the group size of 10 unmasked persons. We will also lift the restriction on the screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments.  11.          Vocalisation activities. We had previously taken a strong position against group vocalisation activities because of the higher risk of transmission. But we are now in a different situation and can start easing this restriction. Subject to masks being worn throughout the vocalisation activity, we will allow the following activities which involve vocalisation by large groups:  a.    Congregational singing and chanting;  b.

Over the past few months, we have simplified our country/region classification and border measures to pave the way for more Vaccinated Travel. With many countries/regions having passed the peak of their Omicron wave and our local COVID-19 situation stabilising, we are ready to launch the Vaccinated Travel Framework for all travellers including Short-Term Visitors (STVs). We will classify all countries/regions either under the General Travel or the Restricted Category and accord border measures by individual travellersâ vaccination status. All countries/regions will come under the General Travel Category to begin with. There are no countries/regions in the Restricted Category currently.    General Travel Category Border Measures  22.          From 31 March 2022, 2359 hours, the border measures for travellers arriving via air or sea checkpoints from countries/regions in the General Travel Category will be as follows:  a.    All fully vaccinated travellers5 and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below6 are permitted to enter Singapore. They will not need to apply for entry approvals or take designated VTL transport. They will continue to be subjected to a pre-departure test (PDT) within 2 days before departure for Singapore, but will no longer be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or undergo an unsupervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) after arriving in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situations and consider removing the PDT requirement in the coming weeks;  b.    Non-fully vaccinated Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) and STVs aged 13 and above are generally not allowed to enter Singapore, with the following exceptions (i) LTPHs medically ineligible for vaccines ; (ii) LTPHs aged 13 to 17, subject to the appropriate measures7 and (iii) LTPHs and STVs with other valid entry approval (e.g. for compassionate reasons). They are required to take a PDT within 2 days before departure for Singapore, undergo a 7-day SHN, and take a PCR test at the end of their SHN period.   23.          To facilitate Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs), Work Pass Holders and other LTPHs who may face difficulties obtaining valid PDTs within 2 days before returning to Singapore, we have introduced remote supervised ART services by approved licensed providers in Singapore for such travellers arriving from selected countries. Going forward, we will accept Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, professionally administered ARTs and ARTs supervised by approved licensed providers in Singapore (including remotely supervised ARTs) taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore as valid PDTs. Travellers who wish to use the remotely supervised ART PDT services licensed in Singapore should book their slots early with these providers via their respective websites and bring along approved ART kits from Singapore for their remotely supervised ART. Refer to https://go.gov.sg/remote-art-overseas-sg for a list of approved remotely supervised ART PDT providers, and the travellers and countries/regions that this service applies to.  24.          We are also working towards the full resumption of land travel with Malaysia for fully vaccinated persons. Details on the exact border measures for fully vaccinated travellers entering Singapore via the land borders will be announced jointly with Malaysia.    Restricted Category Border Measures  25.          In the event of a new variant with potentially significant public health risk, we may re-classify significantly affected countries/regions under the Restricted Category with stringent border measures, such as the need for entry approvals for STVs to enter Singapore. This is to enable us to limit the risk of importing new and potentially dangerous variants if they arise, as well as to buy time for experts to better understand the characteristics of these variants and to develop appropriate public health recommendations.8  26.

Vaccine-differentiated rules still apply. Changes to border measures as below will take place in the coming week.    Quote (1):  ""SINGAPORE - There will be an easing off on mandatory mask-wearing outdoors from next Tuesday (March 29), as Singapore moves towards a new phase of living with Covid-19.  This was among a number of key changes to measures implemented in the fight against the pandemic that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 announced on Thursday.  They include larger group sizes and the lifting of most restrictions for fully-vaccinated visitors entering Singapore.""

Over the past few months, we have simplified our country/region classification and border measures to pave the way for more Vaccinated Travel. With many countries/regions having passed the peak of their Omicron wave and our local COVID-19 situation stabilising, we are ready to launch the Vaccinated Travel Framework for all travellers including Short-Term Visitors (STVs). We will classify all countries/regions either under the General Travel or the Restricted Category and accord border measures by individual travellersâ vaccination status. All countries/regions will come under the General Travel Category to begin with. There are no countries/regions in the Restricted Category currently.    General Travel Category Border Measures  22.          From 31 March 2022, 2359 hours, the border measures for travellers arriving via air or sea checkpoints from countries/regions in the General Travel Category will be as follows:  a.    All fully vaccinated travellers5 and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below6 are permitted to enter Singapore. They will not need to apply for entry approvals or take designated VTL transport. They will continue to be subjected to a pre-departure test (PDT) within 2 days before departure for Singapore, but will no longer be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or undergo an unsupervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) after arriving in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situations and consider removing the PDT requirement in the coming weeks;  b.    Non-fully vaccinated Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) and STVs aged 13 and above are generally not allowed to enter Singapore, with the following exceptions (i) LTPHs medically ineligible for vaccines ; (ii) LTPHs aged 13 to 17, subject to the appropriate measures7 and (iii) LTPHs and STVs with other valid entry approval (e.g. for compassionate reasons). They are required to take a PDT within 2 days before departure for Singapore, undergo a 7-day SHN, and take a PCR test at the end of their SHN period.   23.          To facilitate Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs), Work Pass Holders and other LTPHs who may face difficulties obtaining valid PDTs within 2 days before returning to Singapore, we have introduced remote supervised ART services by approved licensed providers in Singapore for such travellers arriving from selected countries. Going forward, we will accept Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, professionally administered ARTs and ARTs supervised by approved licensed providers in Singapore (including remotely supervised ARTs) taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore as valid PDTs. Travellers who wish to use the remotely supervised ART PDT services licensed in Singapore should book their slots early with these providers via their respective websites and bring along approved ART kits from Singapore for their remotely supervised ART. Refer to https://go.gov.sg/remote-art-overseas-sg for a list of approved remotely supervised ART PDT providers, and the travellers and countries/regions that this service applies to.  24.          We are also working towards the full resumption of land travel with Malaysia for fully vaccinated persons. Details on the exact border measures for fully vaccinated travellers entering Singapore via the land borders will be announced jointly with Malaysia.    Restricted Category Border Measures  25.          In the event of a new variant with potentially significant public health risk, we may re-classify significantly affected countries/regions under the Restricted Category with stringent border measures, such as the need for entry approvals for STVs to enter Singapore. This is to enable us to limit the risk of importing new and potentially dangerous variants if they arise, as well as to buy time for experts to better understand the characteristics of these variants and to develop appropriate public health recommendations.8  26.          See Annex E for details on the border measures for travellers arriving from 31 March 2022, 2359 hours. The latest border requirements can be found on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are strongly advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures before entering Singapore, and be prepared to adhere to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore.
