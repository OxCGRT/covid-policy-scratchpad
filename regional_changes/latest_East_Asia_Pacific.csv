Whereas those in Priority Level 3 will only have to attend their physical classes once a week.

Joining the COVID-19 news conference, Dato Hj Hamzah Hj Sulaiman said in-person lessons will be allowed for preschoolers five times a week, but attendance at kindergartens is capped at 30 percent.    To ensure the safety of preschoolers who are not authorised to receive the vaccine against COVID, only kindergartens that meet health requirements can reopen.    Kindergarten pupils will also be required to wear face masks and undergo antigen rapid tests once a week, with only those producing negative results permitted to attend in-person classes.

We had earlier simplified our country/region classification and border measures on 22 February 2022 to pave the way for more Vaccinated Travel. Over the past weeks, imported infection numbers have stayed very low â around 1% of total daily infections â because many countries have already passed the peak of their Omicron infection waves.  28.          Given the above, we will now further rationalise our travel protocols by switching to an unsupervised self-swab Antigen Rapid Test (ART) within 24 hours of entry for General Category (Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)) and Category I travellers entering Singapore from 14 March 2022, 2359 hours. This will replace the previous requirement for a supervised self-swab ART.
