The Ministry of Health and Medical Services envision that the more the booster dose, the better the level of protection, and the safer it will be to further remove the remaining public health measures. The Ministry is currently looking at 80% booster coverage for those over 18 years of age.  Anyone who is sick should not be attending work or school. If you have COVID-19 symptoms you must get tested for COVID-19.

This includes a new Small Business Recovery Grant for small- and medium-sized enterprises that have been most affected by COVID-19 restrictions, such as those in the food and beverage, retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.    They will receive a S$1,000 payout per local employee, capped at S$10,000 per firm. Local sole proprietors and partnerships in eligible sectors, SFA-licensed hawkers, market and coffee shop stallholders that do not hire local employees will also receive a S$1,000 payout.    In addition, the package covers a six-month extension of the Jobs Growth Incentive to support local hiring to Septmeber, although rates will be stepped down to reflect improved labour market conditions.    SUPPORT FOR LOWER-WAGE WORKERS  Consumers who want to support employers that voluntarily pay their workers progressive wages can look out for the new Progressive Wage Mark from March next year.    With more sectors set to be covered by the Progressive Wage Model in the coming years, the Government will introduce a Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to co-fund wage increases until 2026. This is to help employers adjust to the changes.     The Workfare Income Supplement will be enhanced in several ways. It will be expanded to younger workers aged 30 to 34, and the qualifying monthly income cap will be raised from S$2,300 to S$2,500. At the same time, a new income floor of S$500 will be introduced.    Maximum payouts under the Workfare will also be raised. For example, those aged 35 to 44 will be able to receive an annual payout of up to S$3,000, from S$1,700 currently.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220715220643/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/budget-2022-gst-rate-household-business-support-cpf-carbon-tax-2506736"

"598","Vanuatu","VUT",2022-06-26,"East_Asia_Pacific","H2: Testing policy","2","2","Get tested if you are sick . In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever. It can be more severe for some people and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu.    At Alert Level 0 and Alert Level 1 anyone working in a quarantine facility or at the border should be tested if they have symptoms.  At Alert Level 2 and Alert Level 3 the Ministry of Health will provide additional testing facilities in affected islands and areas and anyone with symptoms should get tested.    https://archive.ph/JElfm"
"599","Vanuatu","VUT",2022-06-26,"East_Asia_Pacific","H3: Contact tracing","2","2","When instructed, âcheck-inâ to venues. If a case of COVID-19 is identified in Vanuatu, we will rapidly try to find everyone who they have been in close contact with (âclose contactsâ), as well as those that were in the same venue or event at the same time but who is at lower risk than a close contact (âcasual contactâ). To enable this, everyone will need to check-in to certain venues by entering their contact details in a registration form on entry. Eligible venues will have signage informing you that you need to register on entry. Once implemented, âChecking-inâ to venues will be required at all levels.    https://archive.ph/JElfm"

This includes someone who has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. Face coverings are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. When using fabric facemasks, ensure they meet the minimum technical standards (3 layers) as recommended by the Ministry of Health.    At Alert Level 1, everyone working in quarantine facilities will be required to wear a mask.  At Alert Level 2 and Alert Level 3 masks will be required to be worn when out of the home. This includes when using shared cooking or bathroom facilities.     https://archive.ph/JElfm"
