The changes, which commenced on 1 January 2021, introduce new insolvency processes suitable for small businesses by reducing the complexity, time and costs required.  The changes will enable more Australian small businesses to quickly restructure in order to survive the economic impact of COVID-19. Where restructure is not possible, businesses can wind up faster, enabling greater returns for creditors and employees.  These reforms are the most significant changes to the Australian insolvency framework in almost 30 years. They form part of the Government’s JobMaker plan to ensure Australia emerges from the pandemic with a stronger, more resilient and more competitive economy. The need to give businesses and their creditors certainty is crucial to kick-starting confidence and activity as the economy transitions to the recovery phase.  /web/20210201223455/https://business.gov.au/risk-management/emergency-management/coronavirus-information-and-support-for-business/temporary-relief-for-financially-distressed-businesses"

The ministry added that religious activities within houses of worship on Feb 11, Feb 12 and Feb 19 will now be permitted, subject to a 30-person limit. All individuals must also wear face masks and observe safe distancing.  Prayers must be kept to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of cleaning and sanitation before the next prayer session is conducted.    The easing of the restrictions comes three days after Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday that Chinese New Year celebrations would only be allowed among family members from the same household.  ...  Ismail Sabri also previously said that temple prayers would be limited to five members from the temple’s management committee.

In broad terms,  the guidelines separate arrivals into specific groups: citizens, permanent residents, families of citizens and permanent residents, long term pass holders, short term visitors and work pass holders.      Short term visitors are allowed to enter Singapore for ""any purpose of travel"" under the Air Travel Pass Scheme if they are travelling from Australia, Brunei Darussalam,  Mainland China, New Zealand and Taiwan.  As noted on 9th February, this arrangement has been suspended for Vietnam.    Short term visitors are also permitted to enter Singapore under the Green Lanes Scheme if the purpose of the visit is ""Business and Official Travel"" AND if they are travelling from Brunei Darussalam, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mainland China, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea.    By implication, this means that short term visitors are not allowed into Singapore for ""Any Purpose of Travel"" if their departure point is not listed.
