For example, at Tokyo university research activities can be continued; however, while taking the utmost consideration to prevent the spread of infection, students, researchers and research staff (laboratory staff) must reduce the amount of time they stay on-site and, if possible, consider working from home.  https://archive.vn/g8dES   https://archive.vn/3zCvR    At Kyoto university, “as a general rule, suspend face-to-face classes and implement online classes instead. If it is necessary to implement face-to-face classes for unavoidable reasons, all possible precautions and measures must be taken to prevent the spread of infection.”. For research activities the guideline is to “Aim to resume normal research activities while taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as ventilating rooms, washing hands, wearing face masks, minimizing contact between people, and reducing the number of non-essential hours that researchers are present in laboratories.”  https://archive.vn/nPoA1  https://archive.vn/yyJMj    Japan's new unified university entrance exams started Saturday (Jan 16) across the country, with organizers taking anti-coronavirus measures, such as requiring test-takers to wear masks and disinfect their hands, and ensuring that venues are well ventilated.

While mask-wearing has become a controversial and almost political issue in some parts of the world, it is already culturally-engrained in Japan. During flu-season, but also year-round, people often wear masks to try to prevent one's own germs or sickness from spreading in public places. This is seen as particularly important in Japan's densely-populated cities. Aside from health reasons, people also regularly wear masks as a defence against dust and pollen, to cover up blemishes or the fact they are not wearing make-up, and even to make the wearer's face appear smaller! Therefore, while mask-wearing has become a hot topic in other parts of the world, they have undoubtedly become the societal norm since the spread of coronavirus, and many commentators have argued this has helped keep Japan's infection rate low.

The ministry added that religious activities within houses of worship on Feb 11, Feb 12 and Feb 19 will now be permitted, subject to a 30-person limit. All individuals must also wear face masks and observe safe distancing.  Prayers must be kept to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of cleaning and sanitation before the next prayer session is conducted.    The easing of the restrictions comes three days after Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday that Chinese New Year celebrations would only be allowed among family members from the same household.  ...  Ismail Sabri also previously said that temple prayers would be limited to five members from the temple’s management committee.

Cardholders making below 30,000 baht a year will receive a cash subsidy of 800 baht a month, up from 300, while those earning over 30,000 baht but not exceeding 100,000 baht annually will see their 200-baht monthly financial aid raised to 700 baht. The state welfare cardholders registered for the subsidies will begin receiving them this week.""         The Thai Government Public Relations Department released a separate statement 20th Jan 2021 ""The Ministry of Finance has assured that online registrations will be available for the extension of the “Co-pay” campaign and the newly introduced Rao Chana, 2-month stipend campaign. Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul said the government will soon extend coverage for the “Co-pay” general purchases subsidy program for an additional 1 million people. The Rao Chana campaign meanwhile offers eligible applicants a stipend of 3,500 baht per month for 2 months. According to Traisuree, registrations for the “Co-pay” campaign open on Wednesday, January 20th, while registrations for Rao Chana campaign are scheduled for some time between late-January and early-February. ""    In statement one - The funding amounts per total earning amounts to not account for more than 50% of earnings.    While not a lot of detail could be found - The terminology ""state welfare card holders"" in the first release and then ""eligible applicants' appears to suggest that not all workers are eligible.
