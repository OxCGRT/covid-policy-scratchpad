All incoming travelers must quarantine.    1.       New Quarantine periods â seven days quarantine for incoming persons who are fully vaccinated and 14 days quarantine for partially vaccinated persons. PNG citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated are to be quarantined for 21 days. Any foreign national who is unvaccinated will not be allowed entry into PNG. Children under the age of 18 years who travel with a parent or guardian will be quarantined for the same period as their parent or guardian. Children under the age of 18 who are unaccompanied will be assessed and quarantined on a case-by-case basis. Children under five years are exempted;    2.       These new quarantine periods do not apply to all persons currently in quarantine â unless provided an exception which will continue to apply;    3.       Approvals to arrive in PNG are valid for 60 days rather than the previous 90 days;    4.       Approvals to enter PNG shall not be provided to persons travelling to PNG for the principal purpose of holidaying, vacationing or similar activity;    5.       All persons travelling to PNG must have a valid COVID-19 test 72 hours prior to their original port of departure, rather than 7-days prior to departing for Port Moresby. For clarity and as an example, if a person initiated their travel in the United States of America and their flight transited through Singapore to Port Moresby, they would need to be tested 72 hours prior to their flight departing the United States of America, not the flight departing from Singapore. Children aged five years and under are exempted from being tested;    6.       All people arriving into PNG must be tested upon arrival and whilst in quarantine. This is the responsibility of the facility hosting quarantined persons. The cost may be passed onto the individual by the facility, but it is the responsibility of the quarantine facility to organise the tests and pass the test results onto the NCC;    7.       If an individual refuses to be tested, they will be quarantined for an additional 14 days;    8.       There is no restriction on which medical providers may conduct these tests, except that the medical providers and their staff must be properly licensed. The NCC will accept results from all such medical testing providers;    9.       Tracking of individuals for the purposes of quarantine is for people in designated approved quarantine facilities as well as home quarantine. They are subject to the Tracpro tracing;    10.    All Charter Flights must â in addition to the normal approvals â have the Controllerâs written approval. This power has not been delegated.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210918052342/https://pg.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"

However, new announcements have been made on the 28th of May to roll out further financial assisstance in light of the recent tightening of covid measures which saw many businesses like restaurants see an economic dive as footfall dwindles and diners barred from eating in. This in turn affected the wages of employees and their ability to make regular payments  such as monthly bills.  ___________________    Quote (1):  ""3. Rental relief  Rental relief will be given to small and medium-sized enterprises and non-profit organisations with an annual revenue of not more than $100 million which are tenant-occupiers of some commercial properties. The Government will grant one month of rental relief for qualifying tenants in government-owned commercial properties. A similar one-month rental waiver had been announced earlier for hawker stalls and coffee shops. For privately owned commercial properties, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) will disburse a half-month rental relief cash payout to qualifying tenants as part of a new scheme, called the Rental Support Scheme.""    ""4. Suspension of repayment for tuition fee loans  The Ministry of Education (MOE) will extend the suspension of loan repayment and interest charges for another four months until Sept 30. This applies to tuition fee loans, study loans and overseas student programme loans for all autonomous university and polytechnic graduates.

They will also be required to perform self-administered ART tests on the third, fifth and seventh day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were close contacts with, followed by another exit PCR test on or after the eighth day at a SASH clinic or PP. If all these are complied with, their HRW period will end on the tenth day of exposure. All swab costs will be borne by the Government.    7.    From 18 September 2021 onwards, individuals who are informed of their HRW or HRA status by MOH through SMS will also receive instructions on the frequent testing regime that they must follow. To facilitate this, such individuals may scan their Singapore-issued ID (NRIC/FIN) to collect a pack (comprising three ART self-test kits) at a nearby vending machine, and use the ART kits for self-testing to fulfil the requirement for HRW. Please refer to Annex B for the list of locations for these vending machines.    8.   From 18 September 2021, individuals who receive an HRA SMS notification should perform a self-administered ART test on the first, third and fifth day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were potentially close contacts with, and monitor their health until the tenth day of exposure.
