Children aged 12 years and below, including short-term visitors, long-term pass holders, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, will qualify for travel under the VTL without the need to show proof of vaccination.

The child must be accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements for entry into Singapore. The child does not need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL.    4.         To safeguard public health, the child is required to adhere to all other VTL requirements:    (i)       Travel History     The child must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries[1] in the last 14 consecutive days prior to departure to Singapore. If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, his/her stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.    (ii)      Designated VTL Flights     The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.    The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore[2] will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights. The child, except those aged 2 years and below, will also be required to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore.    (iii)     Testing     The child, except those aged 2 and below, must take two COVID-19 PCR tests:    A pre-departure test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore and obtain a negative test result; and  An on-arrival test at Changi Airport and remain self-isolated until their test result is confirmed to be negative.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of the CAAS said: âWe have received positive public feedback on the VTL and its extension. Some parents have suggested also allowing their children to travel under the VTL. We have considered this suggestion in consultation with the Ministry of Health and decided to allow it to facilitate family travel. There is some public health risk, but it can be mitigated with the other safeguards. We urge parents to exercise extra care and caution when travelling with their unvaccinated child. We also advise all travellers to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to and adhere to their public health measures.â    Link (2):   http://web.archive.org/web/20211018070920/https://www.caas.gov.sg/who-we-are/newsroom/Detail/vaccinated-travel-lane-to-include-children-aged-12-and-below-to-facilitate-family-travel/"

The child must be accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements for entry into Singapore. The child does not need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL.    4.         To safeguard public health, the child is required to adhere to all other VTL requirements:    (i)       Travel History     The child must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries[1] in the last 14 consecutive days prior to departure to Singapore. If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, his/her stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.    (ii)      Designated VTL Flights     The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.    The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore[2] will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights. The child, except those aged 2 years and below, will also be required to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore.    (iii)     Testing     The child, except those aged 2 and below, must take two COVID-19 PCR tests:    A pre-departure test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore and obtain a negative test result; and  An on-arrival test at Changi Airport and remain self-isolated until their test result is confirmed to be negative.  More details on the VTL requirements into Singapore can be found in Annex A and at https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg.    5.         The VTL was launched on 8 September 2021 for Brunei Darussalam and Germany for vaccinated travellers. Unvaccinated persons, including children who do not qualify for vaccination and persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated, were not allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL. The latest change will facilitate family travel while still safeguarding public health.    6.         Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of the CAAS said: âWe have received positive public feedback on the VTL and its extension. Some parents have suggested also allowing their children to travel under the VTL. We have considered this suggestion in consultation with the Ministry of Health and decided to allow it to facilitate family travel. There is some public health risk, but it can be mitigated with the other safeguards. We urge parents to exercise extra care and caution when travelling with their unvaccinated child. We also advise all travellers to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to and adhere to their public health measures.â    Link (2):   http://web.archive.org/web/20211018070920/https://www.caas.gov.sg/who-we-are/newsroom/Detail/vaccinated-travel-lane-to-include-children-aged-12-and-below-to-facilitate-family-travel/"

The stabilisation phase, which started on Sep 27 to help reduce the strain on the healthcare system, was scheduled to last until Oct 24.   It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).  Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or operators appointed by NEA will receive a 0.5-month rental waiver.

During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).
