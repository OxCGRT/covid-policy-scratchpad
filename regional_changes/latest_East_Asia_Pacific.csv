Use a cloth mask when outdoors.  Do not get close together. Always keep a distance of more than 1 meter from other people.  As much as possible avoid using public transportation.

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Vanuatu. If there are cases, masks will be urgently needed for health care providers caring for patients.
