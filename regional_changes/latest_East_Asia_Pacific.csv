""On-arrival PCR Test for All Travellers and Additional Antigen Rapid Tests for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes  5.

These enhanced measures will apply for four weeks in the first instance, and will be reviewed and extended if necessary.  6.     All travellers entering or transferring/transiting through Singapore, after 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), including travellers from Category I countries/regions, must undergo a Pre-Departure Test (PDT)[3] within 2 days of their departure for Singapore and obtain a negative result.

These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.

Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly.

These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.     We are also conducting a one-time surveillance PCR testing exercise for travellers who arrived between 12 and 27 November 2021 and had travelled to the countries/regions affected by Omicron[1] in the 14 days before their arrival in Singapore. These travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue. We seek the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise.    PCR RRT for Affected Border Frontline Workers  9.     Our borders are the first line of defence against importation of the Omicron variant. Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly. We seek Singaporeansâ understanding and support in the coming weeks as calibration to our measures may need to be introduced quickly given the fluidity of the situation.

We have also ensured sufficient supply of medical equipment such as ventilators, and medication.    Today, we have about 100 ICU beds set aside fro COVID-19 patients, and as of 11 August, 8 COVID-19 patients are in the ICU. We are able to expand our ICU capacity if needed, to cater for any increase in COVID cases who require critical care.    For Community Care Facilities (CCFs), we currently have capacity to accommodate more than 5,000 individuals, and we can add more if needed. The CCFs are mainly run by private managing agents and healthcare providers, and supported by public healthcare manpower. We have also activated the SG Healthcare Corps to support the CCF and other operations. Deployment of the Corps is on-going.     Given the increased need for contact tracing, we have increased our number of contact tracers by approximately 50% since mid-July, from about 300 to 480, to enable rapid detection and ring-fencing of potential cases. The contact tracing team comprises officers from across the ministries as well as volunteers from MOH statutory boards and the Public Service, and is further supplemented with manpower from external service providers.     We make continual assessment of our healthcare capacities and have contingency plans in place to meet various scenarios.

Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected  COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID19 infection. A suspected COVID-19 infection is linked to travel in areas where cases have  been reported, or close contact with someone who has travelled in these areas and has become  ill.  The use of masks is crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone (at  home or in a health care facility).  Effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are frequently clean your  hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1  meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.   https://web.archive.org/web/20211126103746/https://solomons.gov.sb/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-FAQS-FINAL-1.pdf"
