Optional second booster doses now available for those 60 years and above. There is currently no mandate for a second booster dose in-country. A new addition of an approved non-mRNA vaccine (Novavax/Nuvaxovid) has been added to the national vaccination programme; adults 18 and above are now able to opt for this as a booster dose over the other mRNA options that have been on the programme's list since the start of the campaign. As this has been added to the National Vaccination programme, it will be government funded and no out-of-pocket payment is required for those covered by the programme. There is universal availability in-country, only second boosters are given out in prioritised groups.  -----------------  Groups: Universal availability    Vaccines:    1.

This follows the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) interim authorisation of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.    2.    The first batch of the Nuvaxovid vaccine is expected to arrive in Singapore in the next few months if there are no disruptions to the shipment schedule. We will roll out the Nuvaxovid vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine arrive. More details will be shared later.    3.    In the meantime, we encourage those who are medically eligible not to delay their vaccinations and boosters, and to take the mRNA vaccines available in our National Vaccination Programme as this will provide timely and effective protection against COVID-19.

Extensive measures continue to be in place even though resumption of in-person visits to the elderly at healthcare establishments or nursing home have resumed.    ----------------------------  Quote (1):  ""From 26 April 2022, in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes will be allowed for everyone regardless of the vaccination status of patients, residents and visitors.     To protect vulnerable patients and residents from infection, hospitals and homes may continue to put in place certain safe management measures (SMMs) such as:    i.

Allowing only two visitors at the bedside each time to avoid crowding in the wards/Homes       Visits to residential care homes will be capped at one hour, to allow all families of residents the opportunity to visit.

These include allowing in-person visits for all individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) regardless of vaccination status.    2.     MOH had earlier announced the resumption of in-person visits to hospitals and Homes from 4 April 2022 for fully-vaccinated individuals and those who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. With the further easing of community measures from 26 April 2022, there will also be adjustments to the safe management measures (SMMs) for in-person visits to hospitals and Homes.     3.     As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable individuals and there is a need to protect them from infection, hospitals and Homes may continue to put in place certain SMMs such as pre-registration of visitors for patients in Hospitals, and to allow only two visitors at the bedside each time to avoid crowding in the wards/Homes.     4.     As part of social responsibility, all visitors are encouraged to administer a COVID-19 self-test prior to visiting their loved ones at the hospital or Home. Visitors should not visit their loved ones if they are feeling unwell. All visitors entering the hospital wards or Homes must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or residential areas of the Homes, or use the toilets designated for patients/residents in the wards/Homes. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ/residentsâ beds. They should also abide by the hospitalâs visiting hours and do not disturb other patients from their rest.    5.     Visits to Homes will be capped at one hour to allow all families the opportunity to visit their loved ones. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the Home ahead of time. We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details.        6.     Our hospitals are still seeing a higher than usual non-COVID workload.
