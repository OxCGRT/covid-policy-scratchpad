Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. However, if soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and nose with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Practice proper cough etiquette â cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects or surfaces.  Stay home when you are sick â do not go to work or school.    /web/20211108201920/https://www.grta.guam.gov/precautionary-measures-department-public-health"

As a pre-emptive measure in preparations for countering against a sixth wave of infection, free PCR and antigen testing have become available for asymptomatic individuals.    Despite the announcement we cannot find any firm dates when the policy comes in to force. Should dates become clearer at a leter date we will adjust the policy accordingly.    Kishida announced Friday that, while new cases are rising, individuals who canât be vaccinated for health reasons and who donât have symptoms but are concerned they have been infected can receive a PCR or antigen test before taking part in certain economic or social activities.    The plan is part of a greater effort to prepare the country for a sixth wave of the pandemic â and whatever comes afterwards â by bolstering hospitals, procuring more medical staff, expanding its vaccine campaign, administering booster shots and advancing the treatment of those with COVID-19.    âWhile new cases have declined substantially, itâs important to acknowledge the strong possibility that the virus will return and to prepare accordingly,â Kishida said Friday.    Itâs not exactly clear who will be eligible and under what circumstances, but Kishida said Friday that the decision will be left to local governments, who have been directed to execute the plan at the latest by the end of March 2022.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211114022125/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/12/national/covid19-policies-free-testing/    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050612/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/20211107-OYT1T50148/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050745/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/469112  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119042821/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211115/k10013349111000.html (logistics for free asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211112050813/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211108/k10013339271000.html (considerations for asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050557/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00132.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119045214/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00004.html"

Like other VTL travellers, the children do not need to serve quarantine; they will only need to undergo pre-departure and on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, except children aged 2 years and below. From 19 October 2021, the VTL countries will comprise Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). From 15 November 2021, they will also include the Republic of Korea (ROK).     2.         Travellers are advised to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to, including any restrictions on the age of travellers and vaccination status. As of now, Brunei Darussalam does not allow general travel into the country. From 15 November 2021, the ROK will allow general travel into the country under the VTL but this does not include children who do not qualify for vaccination or persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated.    VTL Conditions that Apply to Children Aged 12 and Below     3.         Children aged 12 years and below, including short-term visitors, long-term pass holders, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, will qualify for travel under the VTL without the need to show proof of vaccination. The age of the child will be based on the calendar year. For example, a child born in or after 2009 will be allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL in 2021. The child must be accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements for entry into Singapore. The child does not need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL.    4.         To safeguard public health, the child is required to adhere to all other VTL requirements:    (i)       Travel History     The child must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries[1] in the last 14 consecutive days prior to departure to Singapore. If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, his/her stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.    (ii)      Designated VTL Flights     The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.    The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore[2] will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights. The child, except those aged 2 years and below, will also be required to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore.    (iii)     Testing     The child, except those aged 2 and below, must take two COVID-19 PCR tests:    A pre-departure test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore and obtain a negative test result; and  An on-arrival test at Changi Airport and remain self-isolated until their test result is confirmed to be negative.  More details on the VTL requirements into Singapore can be found in Annex A and at https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg.    5.         The VTL was launched on 8 September 2021 for Brunei Darussalam and Germany for vaccinated travellers. Unvaccinated persons, including children who do not qualify for vaccination and persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated, were not allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL. The latest change will facilitate family travel while still safeguarding public health.    6.         Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of the CAAS said: âWe have received positive public feedback on the VTL and its extension. Some parents have suggested also allowing their children to travel under the VTL. We have considered this suggestion in consultation with the Ministry of Health and decided to allow it to facilitate family travel. There is some public health risk, but it can be mitigated with the other safeguards. We urge parents to exercise extra care and caution when travelling with their unvaccinated child. We also advise all travellers to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to and adhere to their public health measures.â    Link (2):   http://web.archive.org/web/20211018070920/https://www.caas.gov.sg/who-we-are/newsroom/Detail/vaccinated-travel-lane-to-include-children-aged-12-and-below-to-facilitate-family-travel/"

During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.

We have also ensured sufficient supply of medical equipment such as ventilators, and medication.    Today, we have about 100 ICU beds set aside fro COVID-19 patients, and as of 11 August, 8 COVID-19 patients are in the ICU. We are able to expand our ICU capacity if needed, to cater for any increase in COVID cases who require critical care.    For Community Care Facilities (CCFs), we currently have capacity to accommodate more than 5,000 individuals, and we can add more if needed. The CCFs are mainly run by private managing agents and healthcare providers, and supported by public healthcare manpower. We have also activated the SG Healthcare Corps to support the CCF and other operations. Deployment of the Corps is on-going.     Given the increased need for contact tracing, we have increased our number of contact tracers by approximately 50% since mid-July, from about 300 to 480, to enable rapid detection and ring-fencing of potential cases. The contact tracing team comprises officers from across the ministries as well as volunteers from MOH statutory boards and the Public Service, and is further supplemented with manpower from external service providers.
