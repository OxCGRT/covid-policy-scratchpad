The only country-specific exception to the total travel ban is the Reciprocal Green Lane and Vaccinated Travel Lane with Singapore. Other foreigners can only enter Brunei under specific essential travel circumstances (see below). Although a green travel list comprising other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia was originally envisioned for the lifting on restriction on non-essential inbound travel on Jan 1, 2022, this has now been scrapped due to concerns over the Omicron variant.    As per the US Embassy in Brunei's website, last updated on 17 Mar, foreigners that do not have a valid reason to enter are banned from entering.    Entry and Exit Requirements:    Are U.S. citizens permitted to enter?  No.          Effective September 15, 2020, foreign citizens who meet certain requirements may enter Brunei for essential travel only.  All other foreign citizens are barred from entering or transiting Brunei by air, land, or sea.  Visit the website of the Prime Ministerâs Office for the latest information.          Citizens, permanent residents, and other residents of Brunei, including foreign citizens who hold a green identity card, require approval from the Prime Ministerâs Office in order to leave the country. This policy does not apply to tourists or other visitors who do not hold Bruneian government-issued identity cards.  Residents may apply for permission to leave the country by completing an online application at the website of the Prime Ministerâs Office.          Travelers should be prepared for additional travel restrictions to be put into effect with little to no advance notice. Visit the website of the Brunei Ministry of Health for the latest information.      Is a negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) required for entry?  Yes.          Visit the website of the Prime Ministerâs Office for more information regarding Bruneiâs pre-departure testing requirements.      Are health screening procedures in place at airports and other ports of entry?  Yes.          Brunei International Airport implemented temperature screening requirements for all visitors. Temperature screening is also required at all land and sea-based points of entry into Brunei.      Extensions of social visits, professional visits, or business visits while already in Brunei can be made directly with the Visa, Visit and Diplomatic Section, Department of Immigration and National Registration.  Visit the website of the Department of Immigration and National Registration for more information.    ---    Per the Entry Travel Pass requirements, last updated 02 Oct 2020,    The Entry Travel Pass may be issued for the following individuals:  â¢ Essential business travel (including official travel)  â¢ Students  â¢ Individual primarily here for the purpose of medical treatment  â¢ Compassionate and other special circumstances, such as parents, spouse, or other  immediate family members of Brunei Citizens or Residents.

Vaccine differentiated measures have not imposed in schools.  Covid safety measures are currently still enforced in educational institutions.  _________________________    Quote (1):  ""Will Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) be introduced in schools and IHLs?  There are presently no plans to introduce VDS in our pre-schools, primary schools or SPED schools with primary/junior section. Our priority now is to ensure our children are well protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.    Similarly, COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for physical attendance in our secondary schools, SPED schools with secondary/senior sections, junior colleges and Millennia Institute. Access to quality education remains MOEâs priority. However, where there are public health reasons to better protect our students participating in higher risk activities, additional measures would be put in place. For example, unvaccinated students are required to perform a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) prior to participating in higher-risk activities such as singing and playing wind instruments. In addition, under the ongoing MCCY-MOE Team Sports Pilot for schools and IHLs, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an on-site ART self-swab are allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10.    From 1 February 2022, VDS will be expanded to include Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For now, VDS will only apply to all visitors who enter the IHLs. (IHL staff are already subject to VDS via MOMâs Workforce Vaccination Measures.) All students will be exempted from VDS. This exemption is subject to review.    To facilitate the safe resumption of in-person activities for IHL students, all unvaccinated students will be required to complete a weekly self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) regime to take part in higher risk activities on campus which require VDS, such as indoor unmasked activities or large-scale student events.    All staff in schools or IHLs are to adhere to the Workforce Vaccination Measures put in place by MOM.""      ""What are the arrangements for Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) for the resumption of term in 2022?  The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have increased the number of students allowed back on campus at any one time for face-to-face learning.    More student activities and large scale student events will resume in line with national guidelines on group sizes and event sizes.""

About Quick Test Centres (QTCs)  Quick Test Centres (QTCs) provide self-paid ART, where the test will be self-administered and supervised by an approved COVID-19 test provider. The test will cost $15 (inclusive of GST), with payment to be made at the QTCs through cashless modes, such as Mastercard, NETS, PayNow and Visa. Individuals will need to bring along their photo identification for verification at the QTC.    Both the CTCs and QTCs are important as they support COVID-19 testing, which helps to keep our homes and communities safe, especially as we re-open and resume our activities.

Minors aged 3 to 12, must be accompanied by a caregiver, aged 21 years old and above. The caregiver may be required to help administer the test if the minor is unable to do so. The results, which are valid for 24 hours, may be used to meet requirements such as those for pre-event test or pre-visit test.
