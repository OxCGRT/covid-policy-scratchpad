If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, his/her stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.    (ii)      Designated VTL Flights     The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.    The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore[2] will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights.

This comes amid the tighter safe management measures that will start from next Monday and last till Oct 24, including group sizes being reduced from five to two people for dining in. At a press conference  on Friday held by the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said: ""We recognise that businesses will be impacted by these restrictions. They are not the same as the heightened alert restrictions because businesses can still open.  ""But with the reduction of group sizes, there will be an impact on F&B;, retail and other businesses that are dependent on footfall, so the Government will provide a support package to assist the affected businesses.""    This includes enhancing the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for sectors such as F&B;, performing arts and arts education, and gyms and fitness studios. Firms in these sectors will receive 25 per cent of wage support from Sept 27 to Oct 24. Such businesses had previously received 10 per cent of support from Aug 19 to Aug 31. The same enhanced wage support also applies to retailers, cinemas, museums, art galleries, operators of historical sites, as well as family entertainment and tourism businesses. Tourism businesses include qualified licensed hotels, licensed travel agents, gated tourist attractions, cruise operators, regional ferry operators and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) organisers. Rental waivers will be dished out to eligible businesses, such as qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties. Those on privately owned commercial properties will also get a two-week rental waiver under the Rental Support Scheme. This two-week rental waiver will be extended to cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators. Taxi drivers and private-hire car drivers will be given support and receive $10 per vehicle per day in October and $5 per vehicle per day in November, with the extension of the Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund. The extension to the fund will cost an additional $23.5 million and is expected to benefit about 50,000 drivers. This brings the total amount set aside by the Government for the taxi and private hire cars (PHC) sectors to about $500 million since February last year.""

Once registered, an SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number used to register interest, and individuals may use the link to make an appointment at the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre (RCCC) or at any of the 11 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) offering Sinovac-CoronaVac (see Annex A).    b) Persons who have taken at least one dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine at a Special Access Route (SAR) authorised private clinic previously can continue to take the remaining dose(s) of their three-dose regime at any of the PSAR-authorised private clinics (see Annex B). They may proceed to book their remaining appointments at these clinics from 1 November 2021, if they have not already done so. The list of PSAR-authorised private clinics will be updated on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations.    c) Persons who were medically ineligible for a two-dose mRNA vaccine regime and previously invited to receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine under a special public health programme, should follow the instructions provided in their SMS invitation to continue with their regime.     d) Seniors aged 60 years and above who belong to any of the above groups may also walk into the vaccination centre at RCCC to receive their Sinovac-CoronaVac doses, from 31 October 2021, without the need to register for interest or make an appointment.
