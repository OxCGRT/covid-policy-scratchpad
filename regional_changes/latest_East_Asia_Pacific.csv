However, given the rollout of the vaccination programme for age 5-11 in Brunei, it will allow primary schools to reopen on May 14 (as reported by the Star)    As previously reported by the Scoop,    'Child care centres, kindergartens, secondary schools, religious schools, colleges and sixth form centres will resume classroom learning on either April 4 or 5, pending the sighting of the moon this Friday which will determine the first day of Ramadan.    However only primary schools with less than 50 pupils â such as those in rural areas â will be allowed to reopen, while the rest must wait until the government kicks off its COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged 5-11.    Face-to-face learning has been suspended since March 7 after schools reported low attendance at the height of the Omicron surge.    Before retuning to classrooms, the minister urged parents to conduct ART testing on their children twice a week and to regularly report their results to the school.    âIf there are any students experiencing symptoms such as a cold or cough, we hope parents or guardians can send them to the clinic for treatment and not send them to school.â    He added that adolescents aged 12 to 17 who are not yet vaccinated will be allowed to return to schools next week, rescinding a previous policy which did not allow unvaccinated children to attend in-person classes.    This recent announcement brings to an end the third school closure since the pandemic started. The first suspension of classroom learning lasted from March 26, 2020 to June 2, 2020, while the second closure spanned August 9, 2021 to January 2, 2022.'

Coded 2G/1T for 22â27 June 2022.     -	2G for unvaccinated because proof of vaccination for entry is mandatory for some sectors all across the country.     -	1T for vaccinated is primarily due to a small area (Teluk Bintuni) in the province of *West Papua*, where even vaccinated people are subject to capacity restrictions, as strictest measure is coded for. In rest of the country, mostly no capacity restrictions if vaccinated (i.e 0 type of coding).     Policies currently consist of two levels:      I.

Current situation:     Vast majority of Indonesia is presently at PPKM Level 1, which allows for 100% capacity, but this is *conditional* on showing proof of vaccination in some workplace sectors.

However, the planned disbursement for 2022 (originally announced in April 2022) is delayed which is why E1 is coded as 2F instead of âall workersâ for the period of 22â27 June 2022.

The total rebates each eligible household will receive in FY2022 range from $440 to $760, depending on the HDB flat type. They will be given in four tranches - in April, July and October this year, and January 2023. The payments are meant to help lower- and middle-income Singaporeans offset their GST and utility bills. The Government has been giving out GST Vouchers in three components - cash, MediSave and U-Save for utilities - since 2012. From FY2022, the service and conservancy charges (S&CC) rebate will be a component of the scheme. For this financial year, households will receive double the U-Save payments, which come in the form of rebates in utility bills. For those residing in one- and two-room flats, the rebate amounts to about eight to 10 months of utility bills. For those living in three- and four-room flats, the rebate works out to about four to six months of utility bills, said MOF. The payouts, totalling $720 million, were announced at Budget 2022 in February and are part of the enhanced permanent GST Voucher scheme and the Household Support Package. It was also made known that GST will be raised by 1 percentage point a year over the next two years, from 7 per cent to 9 per cent.""

""So we do have to brace ourselves for higher prices for some time.
