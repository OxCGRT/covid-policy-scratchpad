To encourage social distancing and promote the usage of digital banking, online local interbank transfer fees and charges will be waived for a period of six months for all customers.

The fiscal measures include amongst others, the deferment of payments on Employees Trust Fund (TAP) and Supplementary Contributory Pension (SCP) contributions, discounts on corporate income taxes, rents and utilities.  http://web.archive.org/web/20201120183507/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

In other words: Disengaged and Disassociated.  By applying Physical Distancing, the spread of the virus can be prevented. Remember, viruses do not move on their own but people carry them around.  How do I do Physical Distancing?  We must stay at home according to government guidelines.  Work, study and worship at home.  Going out only for essential shopping or medical care. Use a cloth mask when outdoors.  Do not get close together. Always keep a distance of more than 1 meter from other people.  As much as possible avoid using public transportation.  Postpone or cancel family or friends events, visit each other or meet face-to-face instead of communication via telephone, internet, social media or communication applications.  Postpone or cancel gatherings, music concerts, sporting events, religious activities or other activities that invite large crowds.

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Vanuatu. If there are cases, masks will be urgently needed for health care providers caring for patients.
