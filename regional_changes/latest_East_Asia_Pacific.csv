While children age 5â11 were not allowed back immediately after the closure, this has been relaxed since the starting of the vaccination programme for age 5-11 in Brunei.    As previously reported by the Scoop,    'Child care centres, kindergartens, secondary schools, religious schools, colleges and sixth form centres will resume classroom learning on either April 4 or 5 [sic, shifted to April 14 as per Star report], pending the sighting of the moon this Friday which will determine the first day of Ramadan.    However only primary schools with less than 50 pupils â such as those in rural areas â will be allowed to reopen, while the rest must wait until the government kicks off its COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged 5-11.    Face-to-face learning has been suspended since March 7 after schools reported low attendance at the height of the Omicron surge.    Before retuning to classrooms, the minister urged parents to conduct ART testing on their children twice a week and to regularly report their results to the school.    âIf there are any students experiencing symptoms such as a cold or cough, we hope parents or guardians can send them to the clinic for treatment and not send them to school.â    He added that adolescents aged 12 to 17 who are not yet vaccinated will be allowed to return to schools next week, rescinding a previous policy which did not allow unvaccinated children to attend in-person classes.    This recent announcement brings to an end the third school closure since the pandemic started. The first suspension of classroom learning lasted from March 26, 2020 to June 2, 2020, while the second closure spanned August 9, 2021 to January 2, 2022.'
