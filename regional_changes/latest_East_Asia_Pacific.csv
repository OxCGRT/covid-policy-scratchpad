Australia,AUS,04-Jun-21,C1: School closing,"As published on the Victorian Government COVID-19 website, from 11:59 pm on Thursday 3 June 2021, there were some modest easing of restrictions impacting residents of Greater Melbourne and a more significant easing of restrictions impacting regional Victoria.  These changes are in response to continued community transmission within Greater Melbourne and no community transmission within regional Victoria within the last week.   In metropolitan Melbourne schools and universities:   “TAFE and university study must be done from home.  Schools and face-to-face learning are open for  students enrolled in Years 11 and 12, and any other students enrolled in Unit 3/4 VCE studies or the final year of a VCAL qualification or IB qualification  vulnerable children  children of authorised workers who cannot work from home or who are working from home and cannot provide supervision.”    In regional Victoria:   “Schools can resume face-to-face learning for all year levels.  Universities and higher education facilities can resume face-to-face learning with a density quotient of 1 person per 4 sqm.”      Greater Melbourne has the most restrictive government policy response to COVID-19 (including policies specifically related to school/university closures).  In Greater Melbourne some school students (in additional to children of authorized workers and vulnerable children) are able to attend face to face schooling.  Therefore, code changed to a 2.        https://web.archive.org/web/20210604010742/https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/coronavirus-covidsafe-settings   https://web.archive.org/web/20210604011649/https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/statement-acting-premier-2   ",East_Asia_Pacific,2T,3T

Australia,AUS,28-Jun-21,C1: School closing,"New South Wales  In response to a growing cluster of community transmission within Sydney the Premier of NSW announced that more stringent policy settings would be in place for residents of NSW from Saturday 26th June 2021.  More specially for residents of Greater Sydney, including the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong and Shellharbour (all in New South Wales):   Residents must only attend in person education if it is not possible to learn from home.    School holidays commenced in NSW on Saturday 26th June 2021, so this does not impact school attendance.  However, university and other tertiary education students are affected.  As an example the University of Sydney (see archived URL) has moved all in person exams and intensive courses online or otherwise rescheduled/cancelled.  However, the university library remains open for students to access with swipe access.    Decision made to code level 2 to indicate that the higher education sector in the Greater Sydney area is not able to undertake face to face learning.   Changed the code from Monday 28th June as this is the first day that the new government policy is likely to have impacted upon the operation of the higher education sector (ie. it is unlikely that classes were scheduled for over the weekend.)    https://web.archive.org/web/20210628140944/https://www.sydney.edu.au/study/coronavirus-infection-university-of-sydney-advice.html   http://web.archive.org/web/20210628124921/https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/rules/greater-sydney   https://web.archive.org/web/20210628115612/https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/file/Public%20Health%20%28COVID-19%20Temporary%20Movement%20and%20Gathering%20Restrictions%29%20Order%202021.pdf   https://web.archive.org/web/20210628115746/https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/public-health-orders.aspx     The Northern Territory  The Northern Territory  According to a press release on the Northern Territory Government Covid-19 website, on the 27th June the Northern Territory “Security and Emergency Management Committee made the decision under the Northern Territory pandemic plan to lock down part of the NT community.  Effective from 1.00pm today – the Darwin, Palmerston and Darwin rural areas will enter a full lockdown for 48 hours.  That means the local government areas of the City of Darwin, the City of Palmerston, and Litchfield.  This follows confirmation of four new covid-19 positive cases all linked to the Tanami case.”  “Although it is school holidays, schools and vacation care will be closed except for the children of essential workers. Childcare centres will open only for the children of essential workers.”  Furthermore, leaving home to attend education is not one of the allowable reasons to leaving home under the current stay at home orders for the Darwin, Palmerston and Darwin rural areas.    “People are only permitted to leave home for the following five reasons. Masks must be worn at all times when leaving  home:  To receive health care or attend medical appointments. Including to get the COVID-19 vaccine  To undertake shopping and get necessary goods and services. Supermarkets will stay open, so there is no need to stock up on groceries.  To exercise for up to one hour a day within 5km of your home and only with members of your household or one other person.  To undertake essential work. If you can work from home – you must work from home.  In case of an emergency or if there is family violence or to provide essential care to a loved one or dependent.”  Decided to maintain the 2T code, indicating that the higher education sector is closed for in person teaching.  Reason for not coding a level 3 is that it is currently school holidays within the Northern Territory.  This is in line with the interpretation guide “If schools are closed, and this same closure policy then rolls into school holidays, we keep the code the same, for example ‘all levels of education remain closed’. This coding would only go down only once students actually return, when schools reopen”    https://web.archive.org/web/20210628121424/https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/advice-care/covid-19-lockdown-restrictions-in-place  web.archive.org/web/20210627060745/https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/updates/items/2021-06-27-covid-19-update-lockdown-restrictions-in-place   http://web.archive.org/web/20210628132726/https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/business-and-work/essential-workers     ",East_Asia_Pacific,2T,2T
Australia,AUS,29-Jun-21,C1: School closing,"New South Wales:  The government maintains that travel for work or education is allowed if it is not possible to do it at home.

Australia,AUS,04-Jun-21,C6: Stay at home requirements,"As published on the Victorian Government COVID-19 website, from 11:59 pm on Thursday 3 June 2021, there were some modest easing of restrictions impacting residents of Greater Melbourne and a more significant easing of restrictions impacting regional Victoria.  These changes are in response to continued community transmission within Greater Melbourne and no community transmission within regional Victoria within the last week.     Within Greater Melbourne these extended restrictions are enforced, in part, Stay at Home Directions (Metropolitan Melbourne).    The directions mean that for those living in Metropolitan Melbourne:   “There are only five reasons to leave your home  shopping for necessary goods and services  care and caregiving, including medical care or to get a COVID-19 test  exercise  authorised work and permitted study  to get a COVID-19 vaccination.  You cannot have visitors to your home or visit others except for care and compassionate reasons. Your intimate partner and single person bubble may also visit you.”  Regional Victoria no longer has a stay at home order in place.  Greater Melbourne has the most restrictive government policy response to COVID-19 (including with respect to stay at home orders).

Australians who have had their hours of work and income significantly affected due to state lockdowns will be eligible.    “The rapid support will be paid weekly to those workers who reside or work in a Commonwealth declared hotspot and are therefore unable to attend work and earn an income as a result of state imposed health restrictions, which last for greater than one week.  Eligible recipients will receive up to $500 per week for losing 20 hours or more of work, and $325 per week for losing under 20 hours. They must not have liquid assets of more than $10,000.  The payment will be made in respect of the second and any subsequent weeks of restrictions.”  This announcement appears to have been made in response to the extension of stay at home orders in Greater Melbourne.    Those eligible for this new payment will be able to apply for it from the 8th June 2021.  Therefore , while the announcement is noted here, a zero code remains to date.      The payment will complement existing payments including the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment.  The Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is only available to those who “can't earn an income because you must self-isolate or quarantine, or are caring for someone with COVID-19.” Ordinarily this payment is for a maximum 14 day period only.

Within Greater Melbourne these extended restrictions are enforced, in part, Stay at Home Directions (Metropolitan Melbourne).    The directions mean that for those living in Metropolitan Melbourne:   “People aged 12 years or older must wear a fitted face mask when leaving home, unless they have a lawful reason not to. For example:  if you have a medical condition, including problems with your breathing, a serious condition of the face, a disability or a mental health condition.  if you are in the car alone or with someone from your household  if you are doing strenuous exercise such as running or jogging, but you must still carry one..”    There are some exemptions for safety reasons or if it is necessary not to wear a mask in order to carry out your authorised work role.  Furthermore, if you are alone in a confined space wearing a mask is not required.  For example: an essential worker working alone in a closed office would not need to wear a mask.       Within Regional Victoria extended restrictions are, in part, enforced by the Stay Safe Directions (Regional Victoria) (No 3)  For Regional Victoria:   “Face masks must be carried at all times and must be worn indoors. You do not need to wear a mask in your own home or if a lawful exception applies.

These restrictions are enforced by the Care Facilities Directions (No 31).   This direction prohibits any visitors to residential aged care facilities with exceptions for end of life care and limited additional provisions for residents with a mental illness.

This testing is conducted at no additional cost to the traveler in the loading zone between the international terminal and the main international parking lot at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby. Travelers should arrive at the airport 4-5 hours before their flight to ensure sufficient time for testing. The tests administered by Air Niugini, in partnership with International SOS, meet the CDC requirements for entry to the United States.

All mandatory tests or close contacts of confirmed cases and  individuals who have highlighted to have had a possible exposure are free of charge.     Quote (1):  """"SINGAPORE - In what is likely the largest swabbing exercise here involving housing blocks, mandatory tests are under way for residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, as well as staff of shops in seven neighbouring blocks. Voluntary tests are also being offered to those living in these seven blocks after the Ministry of Health (MOH) linked 13 cases so far to Block 506. A similar swabbing exercise earlier this week at Block 501 and Block 507 Hougang Avenue 8, as well as Block 745 Yishun Street 72, saw more than 1,000 residents and visitors tested, with four people returning positive tests for Covid-19.

""""""""The ring-fencing testing is likely to be the norm moving forward, in part because the Delta variant that is circulating in the community now is much more transmissible, and active case finding will help to minimise the extent of any onward transmissions by infected cases.""""    Testing is one of three strategies, on top of contact tracing and vaccinations, to help the nation battle Covid-19 in the face of new, more contagious variants.    MOH had said on Thursday night that Covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from some blocks. Mandatory testing, it added, seeks to detect cases who were still incubating the virus in the first round of testing, conducted on May 21 and 22, and to prevent spread in the community.""""

However, from the Prime Minister's speech dated 31 May 2021 regarding updates on Singapore's Covid management, some enhances to the current processes are underway, and in some urgent areas of Singapore (e.g. areas with possible clusters or existing clusters), these tactics are already occurring.  __________________    Quote (1):  """"we must test faster, and more liberally and extensively. This will enable us to detect COVID-19 cases more quickly. So that we can isolate them and ringfence their contacts promptly, before the virus spreads further.    Many different types of COVID-19 tests have become available, for example, antigen rapid tests (ART), saliva tests, breathalysers, wastewater surveillance, even sniffer dogs. We have been using some of these, and evaluating others, for some time. Each of these new tests is suited to different use cases.""""    """"If you visit a GP or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection, you will be given an ART, in addition to a PCR test. Within 30 minutes the ART will show whether you are likely to have COVID-19. If the result is positive, you can immediately be isolated and the PCR test will confirm your diagnosis later, which may take a day or two. That way we reduce your chances of infecting others, if you are already ill but don’t realise it.    Other tests are coming on stream. Breathalyzer tests, which take just one minute, have been set up at the Causeway and the Airport. They can be deployed to many other places too and soon you will be able to purchase DIY tests over the counter at pharmacies. They are simple to use, and not so uncomfortable. You can administer these on your own. If you are worried that you may have COVID-19 and want to put your mind at ease. Or if you are a frontline worker, and want to test yourself frequently or even daily.    These alternatives to PCR tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious. This will be a big help in slowing down the spread of COVID-19.""""

Our contract tracing operations have vastly improved. The contact tracers are working faster and better, because they have more experience and skills, and better tools. TraceTogether helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days. With SafeEntry, they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases, and inform these potential contacts to come forward for a free COVID-19 test. This is what we did for White Sands, JEM and Westgate, and now NTUC Foodfare in Anchorvale. Because of Singaporeans’ self-discipline, public spirit and support of TraceTogether and SafeEntry, we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively. We can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider.    Our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected, he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household. Therefore, in future, when we identify a close contact of an infected case. We will not only isolate him – the first-degree contact – and test him for COVID-19. We will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately, without waiting to see whether the first-degree contact tests positive. If later the first-degree contact tests negative, we can safely release his household members from isolation. But if later the first-degree contact tests positive, we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier. This more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly, to lead to fewer cases.""""
