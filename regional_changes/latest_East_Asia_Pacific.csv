Exceptions exist for foreigners on business and official travel, studying in Brunei, undergoing medical treatment, and transport operators, among others. Foreigners who can enter Brunei must obtain an Entry Travel Pass with a Bruneian citizen or entity as a guarantor, obtain a negative result from an RT-PCR test within 48 hours before travel, quarantine up to 14 days at designated premises and undergo further RT-PCR tests upon arrival; fully vaccinated travelers may quarantine for a shorter period of seven days. Only vehicles with Transit Permits may pass through the borders. Transport operators who cross the borders frequently must undergo an RT-PCR test weekly.    Fully vaccinated individuals may travel from Brunei to Singapore without quarantine on dedicated Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flights. Travelers must have remained in Brunei or any other VTL country within the last 14 days, undergo pre-departure testing, and self-isolate until negative results of an on-arrival test arrive. Individuals must apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) before travel, with the exception of returning citizens and residents.    Alternatively, a Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) scheme with Singapore is in effect, allowing people to travel for business and official purposes to and from Singapore with exemption from quarantine requirements. Travellers from Singapore who have obtained entry approval under the RGL program must take a COVID-19 test upon arrival and remain in isolation until the test returns negative.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211211031242/https:/www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/550471/brunei-authorities-extend-ongoing-covid-19-restrictions-and-curfew-measures-through-dec-14-update-34    The Prime Ministerâs Office (PMO) said non-essential air travel in and out of the country will resume on January 1, 2022, but travel via land and seaports is still suspended.

On 28 November 2021, we further deferred the launch of the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with countries that serve as transport nodes to the affected countries/regions[2]. These measures will help to reduce the risk of importation of the Omicron variant.""    ""On-arrival PCR Test for All Travellers and Additional Antigen Rapid Tests for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes  5.     To step up detection and containment of the Omicron variant until more information is available, we will enhance our testing protocols for travellers arriving in Singapore after 2 December 2021, 2359 hours (Singapore time) (details in Annex A). These enhanced measures will apply for four weeks in the first instance, and will be reviewed and extended if necessary.  6.     All travellers entering or transferring/transiting through Singapore, after 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), including travellers from Category I countries/regions, must undergo a Pre-Departure Test (PDT)[3] within 2 days of their departure for Singapore and obtain a negative result. All travellers entering Singapore, including travellers from Category II (non-Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)), III and IV countries, must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test on-arrival[4].  7.     With effect from 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), air travellers on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL-Air) [5] who arrived after the cut-off date and time, will also have to undergo additional supervised self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) at a Quick Test Centre on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival. These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.     We are also conducting a one-time surveillance PCR testing exercise for travellers who arrived between 12 and 27 November 2021 and had travelled to the countries/regions affected by Omicron[1] in the 14 days before their arrival in Singapore. These travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue. We seek the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise.    PCR RRT for Affected Border Frontline Workers  9.     Our borders are the first line of defence against importation of the Omicron variant. Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly. We seek Singaporeansâ understanding and support in the coming weeks as calibration to our measures may need to be introduced quickly given the fluidity of the situation.

The vouchers combine regular payments as well as one-off payments that are part of the S$900 million Household Support Package introduced to help families during this period of uncertainty amid COVID-19. Lower- to middle-income families are set to receive more support from the package, which was announced at Budget 2021 in February.FOR     INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS  About 1.4 million citizens will receive up to S$500 in GST vouchers this year. This comprises a one-off GST Voucher - Cash Special Payment of S$200 and a regular GST Voucher - Cash payment of up to S$300. The one-off payment and regular payment will be credited directly to citizens' bank accounts from Jun 23 and Jul 30 respectively, if they have linked their NRIC to their PayNow accounts.    FOR HOUSEHOLDS    About 950,000 Singaporean households living in public housing will receive their quarterly GST Voucher - U-Save rebates in July.  The households will also receive an additional 50 per cent rebate through a one-off GST Voucher - U-Save Special Payment.  In total, a household can expect to receive between S$355 and S$595 in rebates in financial year 2021, depending on the flat type.    Other government payments that eligible citizens can expect to receive later this year include the Five-Year MediSave Top-up scheme, grocery vouchers and top-ups to children's education accounts, said MOF. Households can also expect to receive rebates on service and conservancy charges and Community Development Council vouchers.

However, new announcements have been made on the 28th of May to roll out further financial assisstance in light of the recent tightening of covid measures which saw many businesses like restaurants see an economic dive as footfall dwindles and diners barred from eating in. This in turn affected the wages of employees and their ability to make regular payments  such as monthly bills.  ___________________    Quote (1):  ""3. Rental relief  Rental relief will be given to small and medium-sized enterprises and non-profit organisations with an annual revenue of not more than $100 million which are tenant-occupiers of some commercial properties. The Government will grant one month of rental relief for qualifying tenants in government-owned commercial properties. A similar one-month rental waiver had been announced earlier for hawker stalls and coffee shops. For privately owned commercial properties, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) will disburse a half-month rental relief cash payout to qualifying tenants as part of a new scheme, called the Rental Support Scheme.""    ""4. Suspension of repayment for tuition fee loans  The Ministry of Education (MOE) will extend the suspension of loan repayment and interest charges for another four months until Sept 30. This applies to tuition fee loans, study loans and overseas student programme loans for all autonomous university and polytechnic graduates. MOE had earlier suspended these charges for one year, from June 1 last year to May 31.""

""Some support has been given to businesses and workers to cushion the impact of the measures, but companies have sought more help from landlords and the Government. For instance, food and beverage businesses will get 50 per cent wage subsidies under the JSS during the period for which dining in is prohibited, up from 10 per cent. Hawkers and coffee shop stallholders who are tenants of government agencies will also get a one-month rental waiver.""

Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected  COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID19 infection. A suspected COVID-19 infection is linked to travel in areas where cases have  been reported, or close contact with someone who has travelled in these areas and has become  ill.  The use of masks is crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone (at  home or in a health care facility).  Effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are frequently clean your  hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1  meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.   https://web.archive.org/web/20211126103746/https://solomons.gov.sb/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-FAQS-FINAL-1.pdf"
