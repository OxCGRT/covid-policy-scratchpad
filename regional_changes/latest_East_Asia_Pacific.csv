The changes, which commenced on 1 January 2021, introduce new insolvency processes suitable for small businesses by reducing the complexity, time and costs required.  The changes will enable more Australian small businesses to quickly restructure in order to survive the economic impact of COVID-19. Where restructure is not possible, businesses can wind up faster, enabling greater returns for creditors and employees.  These reforms are the most significant changes to the Australian insolvency framework in almost 30 years. They form part of the Government’s JobMaker plan to ensure Australia emerges from the pandemic with a stronger, more resilient and more competitive economy. The need to give businesses and their creditors certainty is crucial to kick-starting confidence and activity as the economy transitions to the recovery phase.  /web/20210201223455/https://business.gov.au/risk-management/emergency-management/coronavirus-information-and-support-for-business/temporary-relief-for-financially-distressed-businesses"

Notably, there is a culturally sensitive approach to testing: ""As community interactions are likely to increase in the leadup to Chinese New Year, we will carry out surveillance testing for stallholders, shop owners, persons in the food and beverage industry, as well as food delivery persons operating in and around Chinatown. While there has been no evidence that these community groups are at higher risk of infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be offering tests to them as they are expected to interact more frequently with other members of the public during this time. The testing will take place from 8 February to 9 February 2021. MOH, together with other government agencies, will be progressively reaching out to these identified community groups with further details.""

Article notes that COVAX donates part of the vaccine and cold chain, but in order to increase coverage the countries must also contribute to the cost.  Tonga is in discussion with ""development partners"" to secure additional funding.    ""Vaccine priority groups  Tonga’s plan is to prioritize frontline workers (those staff working/managing quarantine facilities, those required to respond to suspected cases, those working at port of entry and transporting repatriated passengers) to receive the vaccine first, followed by the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, explained Dr ‘Akau’ola.  The remaining adult population will follow. Children will be the last priority to be vaccinated.""    Article notes COVAX ""initial plan was to roll out CoViD-19 vaccines to frontline workers only for participant countries""    In the region, several countries have already received vaccines and are have started to implement their vaccination plans including: French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Marshall Is, American Samoa, FSM and Palau.    http://archive.today/2021.01.31-153157/https://matangitonga.to/2021/01/30/tonga-finalizing-plan-access-covid-19-vaccines"

(Context note: population of Tonga is in region of 100,000 people)    ""The other 10 Pacific countries with indicative doses of AZ/SKBio are:    Fiji 100,800 doses;  Kiribati – 48,000;  Marshall Islands – 24,000;  Micronesia (Federated States of) – 48,000;  Nauru – 7,200;  New Zealand 249,600;  Samoa – 79,200;  Tonga – 43,200  Tuvalu – 4,800  Vanuatu 100,800.    The indicative distribution is intended to provide interim guidance to COVAX Facility participating countries to help their governments and public health leaders to plan and prepare for the first rounds of vaccine distribution this year, and a successful national roll out of vaccines.    “It is therefore non-binding and may be subject to change,” the forecast stated.""    http://archive.today/2021.02.08-141121/https://matangitonga.to/2021/02/06/covax-facility-announces-vaccines-release-first-half-2021"
