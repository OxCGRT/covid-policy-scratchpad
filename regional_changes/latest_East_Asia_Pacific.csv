People who should wear a mask:  Health workers and people conducting health screenings  Individuals caring for a person with COVID-19  Individuals who have COVID-19 symptoms who can't avoid contact with others  Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol- based hand rub or soap and water  If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.    There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Vanuatu. If there are cases, masks will be urgently needed for health care providers caring for patients. Because masks are in short supply, everyone is better off if they are reserved for those who actually require them, such as those who can't avoid exposure to people who are or may be infected."""
