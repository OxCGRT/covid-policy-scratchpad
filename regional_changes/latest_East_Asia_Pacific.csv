The public is advised to continue to strictly follow the Ministry of Health and Medical Services Standard Operational Procedures and comply with the curfew order to safeguard themselves and their families from this pandemic.

According to an announcement of Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment for Covid-19, schools in 46 townships of nine regions and states will be excluded from reopening based on the analysis on the test positivity rates per 100,000 people in the past 14 days.

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community.

As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.

With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas.

VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now. We will continue to review the local and global COVID-19 situation and adjust our measures accordingly.    Facilitating Travel for Recently-Recovered Travellers    28.    With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas. See Annex D for the list of documentation to be presented by such travellers at check-in and arrival immigration to qualify for this exemption.""

Present testing policy: lateral flow/rapid antigen tests are available to be purchased at subsidised prices. The government has also distributed some tests for free. Anyone who tests positive on a rapid test is supposed to report it and obtain a PCR test (administered by a health worker) to confirm the result.     Free PCR tests are also being offered to Thai citizens and foreign travellers who require it under the Test & Go scheme, regardless of symptoms.     Additional notes: However, there have been difficulties caused by the shortage of rapid test kits, due to the spread of Omicron increasing demand. Such shortages could impact access to PCR tests, since a positive lateral test is the gateway to getting a PCR test.     Archived source:   1.

"580","Thailand","THA",2022-01-18,"East_Asia_Pacific","H3: Contact tracing","1","2","Classified as limited, rather than comprehensive contact tracing (which requires both declared intention to trace for all identified cases, and evidence of capacity to do so) for the following reasons:    A.	Evidence of high daily case numbers and widespread, ongoing community transmission nationwide, that might render comprehensive contact tracing both impossible and less useful as a disease control measure as opposed to in earlier stages of the pandemic.      Thailand has been recording around 7,000+ new infections/day (as confirmed by a PCR test) for the period of 18â24 Jan 2022.     1.	Thai Department of Disease Control, official Facebook, infographic for 24 Jan 2022: â7,139 new casesâ.     Thai language version: https://archive.vn/G41zn   English language version: https://archive.vn/2nsFe     2.	https://archive.vn/4eGFF â World Health Organisation Situation Report for Thailand for 13â19 Jan 2022: Average of â7,257 new casesâ per day and âcommunity transmission of Omicron in most provinces.â     B.	Recent government guidelines state that people who discover they have Covid-19 after testing with home ATKs (antigen test kits) must report their result to the authorities, get it confirmed with a PCR test and undergo isolation. However, those with mild or no symptoms are asked to self-isolate at home in order âto ease the burden on the public health care system.â     https://archive.vn/oxD9a â Thaiger: âThailandâs updated Covid guidelines: What to do if you test positive or have symptoms.â     C.	Government strategy seems to have also shifted to making home Covid-19 tests widely available for people so they can find out if they should take a PCR test and self-isolate, and utilising vaccinations. By comparison, there does not seem to be much mention of tracing the contacts of all known cases. Nonetheless, the possibility that some contact tracing may still be going on in targeted areas is not discounted.     https://archive.vn/rvnUw â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Twitter post on making antigen kits available at low cost in response to high demand.    https://archive.vn/VEGGV and  https://archive.vn/X2JMF â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Facebook posts encouraging vaccinations. Also emphasises masking, social distancing and good hygiene, but not so much contact tracing.    https://archive.vn/BG9q9 â Bangkok Post, 19th January 2022: ââ¦[A]ll agencies tasked with quelling the outbreak [in Bangkok] have been instructed to focus their efforts on dishing out booster shots, particularly to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.â    D.	Recent mentions of contact tracing usually refer to contact tracing apps. Thai authorities have encouraged everyone to download Mor Chana and Thai Chana, Thailandâs contact tracing apps. However, this by itself does not amount to manual, comprehensive contact tracing carried out by the authorities.
