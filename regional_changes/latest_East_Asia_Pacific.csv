Originally,  ""The first phase will begin on January 3, 2022.     The minister explained that in-person teaching and learning for secondary students in Year 10 and Year 11 will be conducted five times a week, including special needs students from Priority Level 1 and 2. Whereas those in Priority Level 3 will only have to attend their physical classes once a week.     For Year 12 and 13 students, as well as Priority Level 1 and 2, and special need students will also undergo face-to-face teaching and learning five times a week, while once a week in-person classes for Priority Level 3 students.     âMeanwhile, teaching and learning for the remaining students will be made via online or Home Learning Pack (HLP). The first phase is planned to be carried out for at least two weeks whereby the transition towards the second phase depending if there is no increase in the spread of serious cases of infections among the students, teachers and staff as well as on the advice of the COVID-19 Steering Committeeâ, the minister explained.     The minister shared that the second phase is expected to begin on January 17, 2022. However, its implementation will depend on the current Covid-19 situation as well.     In the second phase, said the minister, in-person lessons will be carried out five times a week for students who have completed two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and the increased school capacity from 40 to 100 per cent. This is to be implemented for secondary school students from Year 7 to 11, including special need students in Priority Level 1 and 2. Those in Priority Level 3 will have to attend their physical classes thrice a week, and Year 12 and 13 students, including special needs in Priority Level 1 and 2. Classes for special needs students in Priority Level 3 will be carried out thrice a week.     Lessons for students aged 5 to 11 who have yet to receive their vaccination will continue via online and HLP.     âStudents who continue to have difficulties with online learning will be continued to be supported by the school through the provision of HLPâ, the minister stated. ""    Additionally, from the frst Scoop report,   ""Only fully vaccinated teachers and students can return to primary and secondary schools, sixth form centres and higher education institutions.    Some 98 percent of teachers are fully jabbed while 80 percent of students aged 12-17 have received two vaccine doses, according to education ministry figures.    All double-vaxxed students, teachers and non-teaching staff are still required to undergo antigen rapid tests once a week in the first stage of school reopening.""    â    ""Toddlers aged 3 to 4 can head back to kindergartens from January 17, the education minister said Wednesday.    Joining the COVID-19 news conference, Dato Hj Hamzah Hj Sulaiman said in-person lessons will be allowed for preschoolers five times a week, but attendance at kindergartens is capped at 30 percent.    To ensure the safety of preschoolers who are not authorised to receive the vaccine against COVID, only kindergartens that meet health requirements can reopen.    Kindergarten pupils will also be required to wear face masks and undergo antigen rapid tests once a week, with only those producing negative results permitted to attend in-person classes.    The minister said parents and guardians of the children must be fully jabbed and show proof of vaccination.    Double-vaccinated Year 7-9 pupils will also return to classrooms next week after a five-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, joining Year 10-13 students who were the first group to resume face-to-face classes earlier this month.""

The first phase is planned to be carried out for at least two weeks whereby the transition towards the second phase depending if there is no increase in the spread of serious cases of infections among the students, teachers and staff as well as on the advice of the COVID-19 Steering Committeeâ, the minister explained.     The minister shared that the second phase is expected to begin on January 17, 2022. However, its implementation will depend on the current Covid-19 situation as well.     In the second phase, said the minister, in-person lessons will be carried out five times a week for students who have completed two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and the increased school capacity from 40 to 100 per cent. This is to be implemented for secondary school students from Year 7 to 11, including special need students in Priority Level 1 and 2. Those in Priority Level 3 will have to attend their physical classes thrice a week, and Year 12 and 13 students, including special needs in Priority Level 1 and 2. Classes for special needs students in Priority Level 3 will be carried out thrice a week.     Lessons for students aged 5 to 11 who have yet to receive their vaccination will continue via online and HLP.     âStudents who continue to have difficulties with online learning will be continued to be supported by the school through the provision of HLPâ, the minister stated. ""    Additionally, from the frst Scoop report,   ""Only fully vaccinated teachers and students can return to primary and secondary schools, sixth form centres and higher education institutions.    Some 98 percent of teachers are fully jabbed while 80 percent of students aged 12-17 have received two vaccine doses, according to education ministry figures.    All double-vaxxed students, teachers and non-teaching staff are still required to undergo antigen rapid tests once a week in the first stage of school reopening.""    â    ""Toddlers aged 3 to 4 can head back to kindergartens from January 17, the education minister said Wednesday.    Joining the COVID-19 news conference, Dato Hj Hamzah Hj Sulaiman said in-person lessons will be allowed for preschoolers five times a week, but attendance at kindergartens is capped at 30 percent.    To ensure the safety of preschoolers who are not authorised to receive the vaccine against COVID, only kindergartens that meet health requirements can reopen.    Kindergarten pupils will also be required to wear face masks and undergo antigen rapid tests once a week, with only those producing negative results permitted to attend in-person classes.    The minister said parents and guardians of the children must be fully jabbed and show proof of vaccination.    Double-vaccinated Year 7-9 pupils will also return to classrooms next week after a five-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, joining Year 10-13 students who were the first group to resume face-to-face classes earlier this month.""

Face masks are required be worn at all times, especially indoors or in crowded places either indoor or outdoor.  2. Face mask must cover the wearer's nose and mouth.  3.

Mr Wong, who is a co-chair of the multi-ministry task force handling Covid-19, said during a press conference that the present posture would be maintained as he could not imagine the Omicron wave passing before Chinese New Year.""

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community. This has bought time for us to booster vaccinate more residents, learn more about the Omicron variant and make necessary adjustments to our COVID-19 strategy. As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now.

With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas.

The stabilisation phase, which started on Sep 27 to help reduce the strain on the healthcare system, was scheduled to last until Oct 24.   It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).  Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or operators appointed by NEA will receive a 0.5-month rental waiver.

Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily through the respiratory droplets of infected people, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. These respiratory droplets can reach the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person directly or indirectly (via contaminated surfaces), resulting in infection.  Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.  To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing. Individuals should also observe good hand hygiene and avoid crowded spaces if possible.""""      Link (1): https://web.archive.org/web/20211206075819/https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/general"

Evidence of high daily case numbers and widespread, ongoing community transmission nationwide, that might render comprehensive contact tracing both impossible and less useful as a disease control measure as opposed to in earlier stages of the pandemic.      Thailand has been recording around 7,000+ new infections/day (as confirmed by a PCR test) for the period of 18â24 Jan 2022.     1.

Recent government guidelines state that people who discover they have Covid-19 after testing with home ATKs (antigen test kits) must report their result to the authorities, get it confirmed with a PCR test and undergo isolation. However, those with mild or no symptoms are asked to self-isolate at home in order âto ease the burden on the public health care system.â     https://archive.vn/oxD9a â Thaiger: âThailandâs updated Covid guidelines: What to do if you test positive or have symptoms.â     C.	Government strategy seems to have also shifted to making home Covid-19 tests widely available for people so they can find out if they should take a PCR test and self-isolate, and utilising vaccinations. By comparison, there does not seem to be much mention of tracing the contacts of all known cases. Nonetheless, the possibility that some contact tracing may still be going on in targeted areas is not discounted.     https://archive.vn/rvnUw â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Twitter post on making antigen kits available at low cost in response to high demand.    https://archive.vn/VEGGV and  https://archive.vn/X2JMF â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Facebook posts encouraging vaccinations.

Recent mentions of contact tracing usually refer to contact tracing apps. Thai authorities have encouraged everyone to download Mor Chana and Thai Chana, Thailandâs contact tracing apps.
