However, given the rollout of the vaccination programme for age 5-11 in Brunei, it will allow primary schools to reopen on May 14 (as reported by the Star)    As previously reported by the Scoop,    'Child care centres, kindergartens, secondary schools, religious schools, colleges and sixth form centres will resume classroom learning on either April 4 or 5, pending the sighting of the moon this Friday which will determine the first day of Ramadan.    However only primary schools with less than 50 pupils â such as those in rural areas â will be allowed to reopen, while the rest must wait until the government kicks off its COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged 5-11.    Face-to-face learning has been suspended since March 7 after schools reported low attendance at the height of the Omicron surge.    Before retuning to classrooms, the minister urged parents to conduct ART testing on their children twice a week and to regularly report their results to the school.    âIf there are any students experiencing symptoms such as a cold or cough, we hope parents or guardians can send them to the clinic for treatment and not send them to school.â    He added that adolescents aged 12 to 17 who are not yet vaccinated will be allowed to return to schools next week, rescinding a previous policy which did not allow unvaccinated children to attend in-person classes.    This recent announcement brings to an end the third school closure since the pandemic started. The first suspension of classroom learning lasted from March 26, 2020 to June 2, 2020, while the second closure spanned August 9, 2021 to January 2, 2022.'

Additional Cash payouts in the form of vouchers that can be used at select locations in-country were made available on 11 May 2022. Additional rounds will ensure over the next 2 years; as well as rebates and relief for items such as utility bills. This scheme has bene brought forward as global prices for commodities continue to rise as a consequence of continued COVID-19 induced supply disruptions as well as the war in Ukraine. Financial assistance given by the government is tailored according to the overall socioeconomic status of the household; with lower income households receiving more assistance.  -------    Quote (1):  ""SINGAPORE - All Singaporean households can now collect $100 worth of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers to spend at more than 16,000 participating heartland merchants and hawkers. In addition, $200 more in vouchers will be disbursed in early 2023, and another $200 in 2024, with major supermarkets roped in for the next two years. The latest vouchers will benefit up to 1.22 million Singaporean households. They can be collected digitally from Wednesday (May 11), and can be used until Dec 31 together with the vouchers released last year.""    ""However, he decided to bring it forward as many Singaporeans are concerned about their daily expenses and the impact of rising prices due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. He noted that prices have been increasing worldwide both because of the Ukraine war and the continued shipping and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic. ""Even countries that are oil and gas exporters are facing higher prices, let alone a small and open economy like Singapore that imports almost everything we consume,"" he said. ""So we do have to brace ourselves for higher prices for some time. But rest assured that the Government will continue to do our utmost to help cushion the impact for Singaporeans, especially for our lower- and middle-income families. ""In particular, we will continue to monitor the global situation, and will not hesitate to take further action to help households and businesses if the situation worsens.""    ""Mr Wong noted that the Government is also providing other forms of assistance. The first tranche of service and conservancy charges (S&CC) and GST Voucher (GSTV) U-Save utilities rebates was disbursed last month. Another three rounds will be disbursed in July, October and next January. The payouts are part of the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme and Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022 to defray GST and other living expenses. This means that those living in four-room HDB flats will receive rebates worth about four months of their utility bills and 2Â½ months of their S&CC for the whole of financial year 2022, said Mr Wong.""

The total rebates each eligible household will receive in FY2022 range from $440 to $760, depending on the HDB flat type. They will be given in four tranches - in April, July and October this year, and January 2023. The payments are meant to help lower- and middle-income Singaporeans offset their GST and utility bills. The Government has been giving out GST Vouchers in three components - cash, MediSave and U-Save for utilities - since 2012. From FY2022, the service and conservancy charges (S&CC) rebate will be a component of the scheme. For this financial year, households will receive double the U-Save payments, which come in the form of rebates in utility bills. For those residing in one- and two-room flats, the rebate amounts to about eight to 10 months of utility bills. For those living in three- and four-room flats, the rebate works out to about four to six months of utility bills, said MOF. The payouts, totalling $720 million, were announced at Budget 2022 in February and are part of the enhanced permanent GST Voucher scheme and the Household Support Package. It was also made known that GST will be raised by 1 percentage point a year over the next two years, from 7 per cent to 9 per cent.""
