The changes will enable more Australian small businesses to quickly restructure in order to survive the economic impact of COVID-19.

Victoria  The free Call-to-Test service can provide in-home COVID-19 testing to Melbourne-based Victorians who are unable to leave their home to get tested. This includes older people, Victorians with a disability or mental health issue, carers and people with a chronic health condition that affects mobility.    To be eligible, callers must either have COVID-19 symptoms or be asymptomatic but identified by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a close contact.    Call the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 and select option 9. An operator can discuss your options and support you through the process. To learn more about the Call-to-Test service, visit dhhs.vic.gov.au/call-to-test-covid-19.    Aged-care homes  The Commonwealth Government has engaged Sonic Healthcare to provide a pathology service for residents of aged-care homes. A specialised collector will attend an aged-care facility if a doctor requests for a test. If a result is positive, Sonic will send a specialised COVID-19 collection team to collect samples from all staff and residents.    If you're unwell and think you might have COVID-19, check your symptoms using the healthdirect Symptom Checker.    Call your doctor for advice. You can also access telehealth services, which are subsidised by Medicare.    You can use telephone or video conferencing from your own home or aged-care facility.   /web/20210201224146/https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/coronavirus-covid-19-seeing-a-doctor-getting-tested-faqs"

See previous coding note:     While the official policy still requests closure of restaurants during certain hours, there had so far been no way to enforce these requests.

With the decision to cancel the declaration in the prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka starting March 1, the focus in those areas will shift to suppressing any resurgence of the virus. Although restaurants in the affected regions will no longer be required to shorten business hours and close at 8 p.m., or shut completely, governors in those regions will likely ask them to close their doors by 9 p.m. for some time in exchange for financial compensation of up to ¥40,000 per day.

While mask-wearing has become a controversial and almost political issue in some parts of the world, it is already culturally-engrained in Japan. During flu-season, but also year-round, people often wear masks to try to prevent one's own germs or sickness from spreading in public places. This is seen as particularly important in Japan's densely-populated cities. Aside from health reasons, people also regularly wear masks as a defence against dust and pollen, to cover up blemishes or the fact they are not wearing make-up, and even to make the wearer's face appear smaller! Therefore, while mask-wearing has become a hot topic in other parts of the world, they have undoubtedly become the societal norm since the spread of coronavirus, and many commentators have argued this has helped keep Japan's infection rate low. From our own observations on the ground, it seems at least 90% of people are wearing masks whenever they are outside. They are required for entering most private shops and businesses, and taxi drivers can now refuse customers not wearing masks.""    https://archive.vn/rHRFU"

Listening to these stakeholders illuminated concerns about going back to school and informed the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and Sports and the Ministry of Health in the development of clear guidelines, instructions, and communications materials tailored to the safe return.  A month-long social media campaign was launched to disseminate information on ways to stay protected and keep others safe too. The online reach through social media grew, giving opportunities for children themselves to encourage learning, for example, through 'read aloud' activities but also key messages on returning to schools. So far, the campaign reached 4.6 million people via UNICEF online platforms, including 1.2 million views of the videos since its launch on 22 April 2020.

Up to 15 family members from different households will now be allowed to dine together for their reunion dinner, provided they live within 10km of each other, said the National Unity Ministry.  These family members are also not permitted to travel across state or district boundaries.    The ministry added that religious activities within houses of worship on Feb 11, Feb 12 and Feb 19 will now be permitted, subject to a 30-person limit. All individuals must also wear face masks and observe safe distancing.  Prayers must be kept to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of cleaning and sanitation before the next prayer session is conducted.    The easing of the restrictions comes three days after Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday that Chinese New Year celebrations would only be allowed among family members from the same household.  ...  Ismail Sabri also previously said that temple prayers would be limited to five members from the temple’s management committee.

See the PNG National Department of Health's Facebook post/media release, archived at https://archive.vn/bfZLR    ""He announced that there are four urban clinics in the NCD that are now doing swabbing for COVID-19 tests for those with symptoms of COVID-19 where members of the public can also get their test results within a short time for free. These are Badili, Tokarara, Morata and Gordons clinics. These sites are part of the nine clinics that have been selected to participate in the Antigen (Ag) Rapid Diagnosis (RDT) validation in NCD. The public will be informed when the rest of the nine clinics begin swabbing too.  Other sites that are also providing routine swabbing for symptomatic clients are Pari clinic in Moresby South, and the Port Moresby General Hospital. The general public are encouraged to utilize any of these services to check for COVID-19 infection.  Mr Manning said that this Antigen test is easy and results will be given within 20 to 30 minutes. Further GeneXpert testing is then performed on positive samples to confirm if the patient has the coronavirus disease or not. The turnaround time is about an hour which is more convenient for isolation and contact tracing.

COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. By mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town, all seniors will be able to receive their vaccination. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.    4.    Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.    8.   To ensure that seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations, we will set up more vaccination centres in the coming weeks. Currently, there are 11 vaccination centres in operation[3]. Three more vaccination centres located at community centres/clubs will commence operations by 22 February, at Bukit Timah, Marine Parade and Taman Jurong, bringing the total to 14. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town.
