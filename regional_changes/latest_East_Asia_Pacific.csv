During this period, hospitals and homes can make assessments on a case-by-case basis to allow in-person visits for exceptional cases.      Pre-visit testing requirements at hospitals and homes  Visitors who are allowed into hospital wards and homes will be required to show a valid negative ART result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit. All tests are to be self-funded by the visitor. This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2.  Fully vaccinated or medically ineligible visitors can perform an unsupervised self-administered ART or opt for an ART administered by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres) to fulfil the pre-visit testing requirement. They will be required to show evidence of a valid ART result, e.g. present a time-stamped photo of the dated ART result and photo ID for verification prior to entry.  Non-fully vaccinated visitors would be required to show results of ART  administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including  Quick Test Centres). Results from unsupervised self-administered ART will not be  accepted for this group of visitors.  In-person visits at hospitals    The following patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospitals:   Patients who are in critical condition;    Paediatric patients;   Birthing/post-partum mothers; and    Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples of caregivers include those providing assistance to inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.    The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patientâs bedside at any one time.   All visitors approved to enter hospital wards must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or use the patientsâ toilets in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ beds.  In-situ recovery for some nursing home residents   From 16 February 2022, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will progressively support nursing homes to care for their fully-vaccinated residents who have been infected but have mild or no symptoms within their premises. These residents will be isolated from the other uninfected residents.   Infected residents who are assessed to be at higher risk, or who show signs of clinical deterioration will continue to be conveyed to an appropriate care facility for recovery.      1Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals   2 Recovered individuals (within last 180 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic  offering ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing services.""

Extensive measures continue to be in place even though resumption of in-person visits to the elderly at healthcare establishments or nursing home have resumed.    ----------------------------  Quote (1):  ""From 26 April 2022, in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes will be allowed for everyone regardless of the vaccination status of patients, residents and visitors.     To protect vulnerable patients and residents from infection, hospitals and homes may continue to put in place certain safe management measures (SMMs) such as:    i. Pre-registration of visitors for patients in hospitals; and   ii. Allowing only two visitors at the bedside each time to avoid crowding in the wards/Homes       Visits to residential care homes will be capped at one hour, to allow all families of residents the opportunity to visit.      A summary of these SMMs for visitors is listed below:    Dos	 Donâts  Schedule the visits with the homes ahead of time  Exercise social responsibility by administering a COVID-19 self-test before visiting the patients/residents   Don face masks^ with good filtration capability at all times  Abide by the hospitalâs visiting hours  Visit the patients and residents if you are feeling unwell   Eat or drink in the hospital wards   Use the patientsâ toilets in the wards/Homes  Sit on patientsâ/residentsâ beds   Disturb other patients from their rest   ^These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric.

These include allowing in-person visits for all individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) regardless of vaccination status.    2.     MOH had earlier announced the resumption of in-person visits to hospitals and Homes from 4 April 2022 for fully-vaccinated individuals and those who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. With the further easing of community measures from 26 April 2022, there will also be adjustments to the safe management measures (SMMs) for in-person visits to hospitals and Homes.     3.     As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable individuals and there is a need to protect them from infection, hospitals and Homes may continue to put in place certain SMMs such as pre-registration of visitors for patients in Hospitals, and to allow only two visitors at the bedside each time to avoid crowding in the wards/Homes.     4.     As part of social responsibility, all visitors are encouraged to administer a COVID-19 self-test prior to visiting their loved ones at the hospital or Home. Visitors should not visit their loved ones if they are feeling unwell. All visitors entering the hospital wards or Homes must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or residential areas of the Homes, or use the toilets designated for patients/residents in the wards/Homes. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ/residentsâ beds. They should also abide by the hospitalâs visiting hours and do not disturb other patients from their rest.    5.     Visits to Homes will be capped at one hour to allow all families the opportunity to visit their loved ones. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the Home ahead of time. We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details.        6.     Our hospitals are still seeing a higher than usual non-COVID workload. We seek the publicâs continued cooperation to comply with the measures and remain socially responsible to keep patients/residents safe even as we take strides towards normalcy.""
