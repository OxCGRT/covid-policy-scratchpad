To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees.    a. Live performances and MICE. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments).    b. Spectator and participatory sports events. Up to 100 persons may be allowed for spectator and participatory sports events with PET implemented. PET would not be required if there are 50 persons or less. Further details will be issued by SportSG.    c. Marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions. Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET, and 50 participants without PET. We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over the past few months. Hence, as a special provision, wedding receptions may be allowed to continue with up to 100 persons with PET for all persons, and with a group size of up to 5 persons per table. This will allow couples to continue with their wedding plans, albeit with some adjustments. All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. Given their higher vulnerability, we also strongly discourage unvaccinated individuals from attending such events until they are fully vaccinated.    d. Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTIâs prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET.    e. Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Only up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema.    f. Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind or brass instruments will also be suspended during this period.    g. Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%.    h. Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area, to 16sqm per person.""

"534","Singapore","SGP",2021-08-20,"East_Asia_Pacific","C8: International travel controls","3","3","As of the 20th of August 2021, Singapore began opening up the borders, even to previously banned countries, and will be restructuring the framework for handling inbound travellers.  ________________  Quote (1):  ""10.      As a first step, we have reviewed the country/ region classifications for our border measures. Countries/ regions will be classified in one of four categories, each with differentiated border measures, premised on a travellerâs 21-day travel history prior to their entry into Singapore. If the traveller visits or transits through countries/ regions in different categories, the most stringent set of requirements among those countries/ regions will apply. The updated classification, together with the associated testing requirements, can be found in Annex B and on the SafeTravel website.    a.    Category I â Travellers from countries/ regions in this category can enter Singapore without having to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN). They will only be subject to an On-Arrival COVID-19 PCR2 and if negative, will be allowed to go about their activities. This would include countries/regions such as Mainland China (excluding Jiangsu province), New Zealand and Taiwan today.    i.     We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong and Macao, and will also add them to this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours. See Annex C for details.    b.    Category II â Travellers from countries/ regions in this category will be required to undergo a 7-day SHN, which can be served at their accommodation of choice. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders may serve their 7-day SHN at their place of residence, if conditions are suitable. Currently, only Mainland China (Jiangsu province) is in this category.     i.     We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Australia, Canada, and Germany, and will add these countries/ regions to this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours. We have also reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Brunei, and will place them in  this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours (see Annex C).    c.     Category III â Unvaccinated travellers from countries/ regions in this category will be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. Travellers who are fully vaccinated3 may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable accommodation of their choice, if they fulfil the criteria in Annex D. Currently, Austria, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland are in this category.    i.     We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Belgium, Denmark, Japan and Luxembourg, and will add these countries/ regions to this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hrs.    d.    Category IV â Travellers from all other countries/ regions (except Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where entry is currently not allowed4) will be required to undergo a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities. Travellers will also be required to comply with the testing regime as indicated in Annex B.    Starting Vaccinated Travel Lanes    11.     Beyond the above framework, we will implement a new Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) to facilitate fully vaccinated persons to travel into Singapore under reduced border measures.  We will start pilot VTL arrangements with Brunei and Germany. In lieu of SHN, these vaccinated travellers under the VTL will undergo multiple COVID-19 PCR tests, including a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours of their scheduled departure for Singapore, an on-arrival PCR test upon arriving in Singapore, and two additional PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 of their stay in Singapore (if they have not left yet).    12.     The number of VTL travellers will be limited by available flights dedicated to the scheme. VTL travellers must also travel on non-stop designated flights to Singapore.    13.     Prior to travelling to Singapore, short-term visitors and Long-Term Pass holders who wish to travel under the VTL will need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass between 7 and 30 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. Applications for the VTP will start from 1 September 2021 for travel into Singapore from 8 September 2021. Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are vaccinated will automatically qualify and will not need to apply for the VTP in order to travel under the VTL. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will provide more details.    14.     As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore.""
