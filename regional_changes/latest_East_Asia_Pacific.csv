To be eligible for a shortened quarantine period, Japan has so far designated only Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna as valid certificates of vaccination. All certificates must be issued by the public institution from government or country of origin, and must be written in either Japanese or English containing the following information: name, date of birth, vaccine name or manufacturer, vaccination date, dose. In addition, 14-days or more must have passed from the second dose date.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211017184357/https://jp.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211008204749/https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/files/100238774.pdf  https://web.archive.org/web/20211017184616/https://www.anzen.mofa.go.jp/info/pcwideareaspecificinfo_2021C129.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211017184818/https://www.anzen.mofa.go.jp/covid19/certificate_to_Japan.html"

MOE will progressively bring Primary 1 to 6 students back to school for face-to-face lessons from Monday, 11 October 2021, to ensure physical schooling resumes in a safe manner. This is in line with our approach to minimise prolonged HBL where possible, for the socio-emotional well-being of students.    Phased Resumption of Face-To-Face Classes  2. To ensure that Safe Management Measures (SMMs) can be implemented effectively as students return to school, MOE will phase the return of students next week:    Primary 3 to 6 students returning from Monday, 11 October.  Primary 1 and 2 students to continue with HBL on Monday, 11 and Tuesday, 12 October, and return to school for face-to-face lessons only from Wednesday, 13 October. SPED schools will be provided with more details on the phased return of students.  3.

Cancellation of Year-End Examinations for Primary 3 and 4 Students  5. To allow more time for curriculum recovery due to disruptions brought about by COVID-19, the year-end examinations for Primary 3 and 4 students will be cancelled3. Schools will be able to draw on information from a range of school-based assessments that were conducted throughout the year to report students' learning progress and provide feedback, as well as make recommendations on students' subject combination (e.g. whether to offer Standard or Foundation level for specific subjects from the start of Primary 5), where necessary.    6. The year-end examinations for Primary 5 students will still proceed under strict SMMs, as it will allow students and parents to obtain a better understanding of students' learning progress in relation to the Achievement Level (AL) scoring system, prior to taking the PSLE next year.    PSLE Marking Exercise (18 â 21 Oct) & School Holiday (22 Oct)  7. The 2021 PSLE Marking Exercise will be conducted over four days, from 18 to 21 October.

From 6 October 2021, 2359 hours, prevailing border measures for incoming travellers will be determined based on the  travellersâ recent travel history in the last 14 days instead of the existing 21 days. The SHN period for those who currently  have to serve 14 days, will also be reduced to 10 days, in line with the shortening of quarantine period, which accounts for  the shorter incubation period of the Delta variant.  As part of our regular reviews of our border measures, we have also  made the appropriate adjustments to the categories of some countries/ regions.

From 6 October 2021, 2359 hours, prevailing border measures for incoming travellers will be determined based on the  travellersâ recent travel history in the last 14 days instead of the existing 21 days. The SHN period for those who currently  have to serve 14 days, will also be reduced to 10 days, in line with the shortening of quarantine period, which accounts for  the shorter incubation period of the Delta variant.  As part of our regular reviews of our border measures, we have also  made the appropriate adjustments to the categories of some countries/ regions. Details of the updated country/region  classification and their corresponding border measure may be found in Annex A  (https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/mtf-press-release-2-oct-2021---annex-a.pdf?  sfvrsn=8ff45acc_0). As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our  roadmap to becoming a COVID-19 resilient nation.     Vaccination as Entry Requirement for Long-Term Pass Holders   11. To allow the necessary workers and students to enter Singaporeâs borders in a safe and calibrated manner while  minimising public health risk, we will require all Work Pass and Studentâs Pass holders to be fully vaccinated before arrival  in Singapore. This will apply to those who are applying to enter Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane and  Studentâs Pass Holder Lane from 1 November 2021 . More details on the vaccination requirement can be found in Annex B  (https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/mtf-press-release-2-oct-2021---annex-b.pdf?  sfvrsn=851844ff_0).  12. For all travellers applying for entry to Singapore via the Familial Ties Lane from 1 November 2021, priority will be given  to those who are fully vaccinated.""

Like other VTL travellers, the children do not need to serve quarantine; they will only need to undergo pre-departure and on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, except children aged 2 years and below. From 19 October 2021, the VTL countries will comprise Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). From 15 November 2021, they will also include the Republic of Korea (ROK).     2.         Travellers are advised to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to, including any restrictions on the age of travellers and vaccination status. As of now, Brunei Darussalam does not allow general travel into the country. From 15 November 2021, the ROK will allow general travel into the country under the VTL but this does not include children who do not qualify for vaccination or persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated.    VTL Conditions that Apply to Children Aged 12 and Below     3.         Children aged 12 years and below, including short-term visitors, long-term pass holders, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, will qualify for travel under the VTL without the need to show proof of vaccination. The age of the child will be based on the calendar year. For example, a child born in or after 2009 will be allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL in 2021. The child must be accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements for entry into Singapore. The child does not need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL.    4.         To safeguard public health, the child is required to adhere to all other VTL requirements:    (i)       Travel History     The child must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries[1] in the last 14 consecutive days prior to departure to Singapore. If the child has been in Singapore within those last 14 days, his/her stay in Singapore can be counted towards fulfilling this 14-day travel history requirement.    (ii)      Designated VTL Flights     The child who is travelling to Singapore under the VTL must travel into Singapore on designated VTL flights.    The child who is transferring or transiting through Singapore[2] will also be allowed to travel on the designated VTL flights. The child, except those aged 2 years and below, will also be required to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore.    (iii)     Testing     The child, except those aged 2 and below, must take two COVID-19 PCR tests:    A pre-departure test within 48 hours before departing to Singapore and obtain a negative test result; and  An on-arrival test at Changi Airport and remain self-isolated until their test result is confirmed to be negative.  More details on the VTL requirements into Singapore can be found in Annex A and at https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg.    5.         The VTL was launched on 8 September 2021 for Brunei Darussalam and Germany for vaccinated travellers. Unvaccinated persons, including children who do not qualify for vaccination and persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated, were not allowed to enter Singapore under the VTL. The latest change will facilitate family travel while still safeguarding public health.    6.         Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of the CAAS said: âWe have received positive public feedback on the VTL and its extension. Some parents have suggested also allowing their children to travel under the VTL. We have considered this suggestion in consultation with the Ministry of Health and decided to allow it to facilitate family travel. There is some public health risk, but it can be mitigated with the other safeguards. We urge parents to exercise extra care and caution when travelling with their unvaccinated child. We also advise all travellers to check the prevailing entry requirements imposed by the countries they are travelling to and adhere to their public health measures.â    Link (2):   http://web.archive.org/web/20211018070920/https://www.caas.gov.sg/who-we-are/newsroom/Detail/vaccinated-travel-lane-to-include-children-aged-12-and-below-to-facilitate-family-travel/"

The sum will be funded from the higher-than-expected revenues collected by the Government to date, with no further draw on past reserves, said the Health Ministry on Friday (Sept 24). This comes amid the tighter safe management measures that will start from next Monday and last till Oct 24, including group sizes being reduced from five to two people for dining in. At a press conference  on Friday held by the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said: ""We recognise that businesses will be impacted by these restrictions. They are not the same as the heightened alert restrictions because businesses can still open.  ""But with the reduction of group sizes, there will be an impact on F&B;, retail and other businesses that are dependent on footfall, so the Government will provide a support package to assist the affected businesses.""    This includes enhancing the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for sectors such as F&B;, performing arts and arts education, and gyms and fitness studios. Firms in these sectors will receive 25 per cent of wage support from Sept 27 to Oct 24. Such businesses had previously received 10 per cent of support from Aug 19 to Aug 31. The same enhanced wage support also applies to retailers, cinemas, museums, art galleries, operators of historical sites, as well as family entertainment and tourism businesses. Tourism businesses include qualified licensed hotels, licensed travel agents, gated tourist attractions, cruise operators, regional ferry operators and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) organisers. Rental waivers will be dished out to eligible businesses, such as qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties. Those on privately owned commercial properties will also get a two-week rental waiver under the Rental Support Scheme. This two-week rental waiver will be extended to cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators. Taxi drivers and private-hire car drivers will be given support and receive $10 per vehicle per day in October and $5 per vehicle per day in November, with the extension of the Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund. The extension to the fund will cost an additional $23.5 million and is expected to benefit about 50,000 drivers. This brings the total amount set aside by the Government for the taxi and private hire cars (PHC) sectors to about $500 million since February last year.""
