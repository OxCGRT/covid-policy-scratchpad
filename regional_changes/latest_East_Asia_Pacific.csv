Level 3 is a relaxation of COVID restrictions made of of a combination of layered safety measures allowing student and staff wellness while keeping schools open. This provision has allowed for more school activities including dancing and some music classes, school sports, and now fully vaccinated visitors being allowed on site to support curriculum delivery, wellbeing programs and school operations.    Continuing 25 October policy is still in place where schools of all grades have returned to face-to-face learning either through a âstaged returnâ or âfull returnâ, depending on health conditions in their area. Now in areas where 75% of the eligible population over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated, students in kindergarten, years 1 and 12 return to in-person teaching. While in indoor settings in schools, masks or face coverings are required for all staff and all students in Year 7 and above. Masks are strongly recommended for primary students.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119173807/https://education.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/advice-for-families"

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. However, if soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and nose with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

As a pre-emptive measure in preparations for countering against a sixth wave of infection, free PCR and antigen testing have become available for asymptomatic individuals.    Despite the announcement we cannot find any firm dates when the policy comes in to force. Should dates become clearer at a leter date we will adjust the policy accordingly.    Kishida announced Friday that, while new cases are rising, individuals who canât be vaccinated for health reasons and who donât have symptoms but are concerned they have been infected can receive a PCR or antigen test before taking part in certain economic or social activities.    The plan is part of a greater effort to prepare the country for a sixth wave of the pandemic â and whatever comes afterwards â by bolstering hospitals, procuring more medical staff, expanding its vaccine campaign, administering booster shots and advancing the treatment of those with COVID-19.    âWhile new cases have declined substantially, itâs important to acknowledge the strong possibility that the virus will return and to prepare accordingly,â Kishida said Friday.    Itâs not exactly clear who will be eligible and under what circumstances, but Kishida said Friday that the decision will be left to local governments, who have been directed to execute the plan at the latest by the end of March 2022.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211114022125/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/12/national/covid19-policies-free-testing/    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050612/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/20211107-OYT1T50148/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050745/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/469112  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119042821/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211115/k10013349111000.html (logistics for free asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211112050813/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211108/k10013339271000.html (considerations for asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050557/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00132.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119045214/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00004.html"

Despite rising global caution regarding the new variant, Omicron, singapore has maintained open borders for now, instead of closing or banning travelers from specific countries, the government has taken on a more intensive approach with targeted testing, isolation and deferment of VTLs until further notice.  ________________________    Quote (1):  ""Deferment of Vaccinated Travel Lanes with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE  2.     We had previously announced that we will be launching Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from 6 December 2021, with applications for the Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders opening on 29 November 2021.   3.     On 26 November 2021, the WHO classified a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, known as Omicron (B.1.1.529), as a variant of concern. Scientists around the world are presently working to determine the characteristics of the new Omicron variant, such as whether it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, and if it is more likely to lead to severe illnesses. Singapore has not detected any cases of this variant to date.   4.     As a precautionary move to reduce the risks of importation and spread of the Omicron variant to Singapore, we will be deferring the commencement of the VTLs for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE until further notice. This is in view of their proximity as transport nodes to the affected countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe1. We will provide more details on the commencement of these VTLs at a later date.    Regular Review of Border Measures  5.     We are reviewing our border measures, and will announce more details soon.      6.     As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore; and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.

In response to the emergence of a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, which has since been termed the Omicron variant, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 26 November 2021 travel restrictions for affected countries/regions[1]. On 28 November 2021, we further deferred the launch of the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with countries that serve as transport nodes to the affected countries/regions[2]. These measures will help to reduce the risk of importation of the Omicron variant.""    ""On-arrival PCR Test for All Travellers and Additional Antigen Rapid Tests for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes  5.     To step up detection and containment of the Omicron variant until more information is available, we will enhance our testing protocols for travellers arriving in Singapore after 2 December 2021, 2359 hours (Singapore time) (details in Annex A). These enhanced measures will apply for four weeks in the first instance, and will be reviewed and extended if necessary.  6.     All travellers entering or transferring/transiting through Singapore, after 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), including travellers from Category I countries/regions, must undergo a Pre-Departure Test (PDT)[3] within 2 days of their departure for Singapore and obtain a negative result. All travellers entering Singapore, including travellers from Category II (non-Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)), III and IV countries, must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test on-arrival[4].  7.     With effect from 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), air travellers on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL-Air) [5] who arrived after the cut-off date and time, will also have to undergo additional supervised self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) at a Quick Test Centre on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival. These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.     We are also conducting a one-time surveillance PCR testing exercise for travellers who arrived between 12 and 27 November 2021 and had travelled to the countries/regions affected by Omicron[1] in the 14 days before their arrival in Singapore. These travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue. We seek the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise.    PCR RRT for Affected Border Frontline Workers  9.     Our borders are the first line of defence against importation of the Omicron variant. Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly. We seek Singaporeansâ understanding and support in the coming weeks as calibration to our measures may need to be introduced quickly given the fluidity of the situation.

Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.    To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing.
