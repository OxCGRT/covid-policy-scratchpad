The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will update its schedules next week, with software payroll companies to update over the coming weeks, to get more money into the pockets of hard-working Australians as quickly as possible.    Getting money into the pockets of Australians will give them more to spend at their local shops helping to create more jobs.    Our business tax relief measures will also help to keep businesses to stay afloat, to grow and to hire more people.    It is estimated our tax relief package to reduce the personal income tax burden and encourage business investment will create around 100,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22 and boost GDP by around $6 billion in 2020-21 and $19 billion in 2021-22.    http://archive.today/2020.10.19-200109/https://www.pm.gov.au/media/tax-relief-back-hard-working-australians-and-create-more-jobs-passes-parliament"

Therefore consistent adult supervision is recommended to ensure appropriate and safe use of masks by these young children.    26.      Our current guidelines allow for greater flexibility on mask use for young children, and permit children 12 years old and below to use a face shield in place of a mask.  These are already consistent with WHO and UNICEFâs recommendations but not fully reflected in our current laws. We will be therefore adjusting the legal cut-off age for children to wear masks to 6 years old and above, up from the current 2 years old and above.    27.

Singapore,SGP,East_Asia_Pacific,20200928,C2: Workplace closing,1,1,1G,1G,"""6.    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has updated the Requirements for Safe Management Measures (SMM) at the Workplace to continue to ensure safe workplaces for all. These updated requirements will take effect from 28 September 2020.    More employees may return to the workplace   7.     Working from home remains the default mode of working. We will allow more employees (presently working from home) to return to the workplaces. But employers must ensure that (i) such employees continue to work from home for at least half their working time, and (ii) no more than half of such employees are at the workplace at any point in time [1].     8.        With more employees returning to the workplace, employers should play their part in minimising crowding and possible congregation at common spaces, including on public transport. They can do so by:  a. Implementing flexible workplace hours to allow employees who can, to work partly at home and partly at the workplace such that they travel outside of peak periods, e.g. blocks of 10am-4pm or 1-5pm in-office hours, or return to the workplace only for meetings and work-from-home the rest of the time.   b. Further staggering of reporting times such that half of all employees start work at or after 10am.     9.       In addition, split team or shift arrangements must continue to be implemented, with each team restricted to one worksite where possible. Employers must also ensure clear separation of employees on different teams or shifts.     10.    This update has been carefully considered to balance the concerns of employers regarding the impact of extended periods of working-from-home on productivity and workplace relations, while creating safe workplaces for employees. This will also support employees who face particular difficulty working-from-home. As these measures will need to be in place for some time, we encourage employers to ensure that work-from-home arrangements are implemented in a sustainable manner to enable employees to maintain work-life balance while continuing to meet business needs.    (...) 13.     To reduce the risk of transmission with the gradual resumption of activities, employers must continue to ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1 metre and demarcate safe physical distances:  a. Between all persons at meeting rooms, work areas, and workstations; and  b. At all times during work-related events held at the workplace.    14.      In addition, employers must continue to ensure good workplace SMMs such as controlling access at the workplace and cleaning of common spaces regularly. Employees should also do their part in adhering to the measures to create a safe working environment.    15.       The tripartite partners â MOM, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) will continue to review the requirements periodically to take further developments into account, such as updated medical advice, technological updates and operational practices. These updates will help employers to keep workplaces safe amidst the fluid COVID-19 situation, while streamlining processes where possible.    16.       To continue to ensure safe workplaces for all and minimise the risk of widespread re-emergence of COVID-19 in the community, the onus is on employers and employees to comply with the SMM requirements, including the use of SafeEntry to check-in all employees and visitors as required. Non-compliance with SMMs may result in penalties such as suspension of on-site operations, fines, and withholding of payouts for government support schemes and grants. More severe violations of SMMs may result in prosecution. The SnapSAFE app may continue to be used to report any breach of the requirements at the workplace.""

All these are very important questions that we ask ourselves constantly.  Sir, if all of us continue to work together and keep our guard up even as more activities resume, we will be able to keep the pandemic under control, and progress towards further opening up our economy and society steadily.  For instance, we could consider allowing for general group sizes larger than five, so that larger families or groups of friends could meet and have meals together.  We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time.

Earlier, we had also allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and allowed an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Zoo and Bird Park.

Singapore,SGP,East_Asia_Pacific,20201015,H6: Facial Coverings,4,1,4G,4G,"Current answer to: ""Why and when must I wear a mask?"" on Ministry of Health Covid-19 FAQs  https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs    ""It is mandatory for all persons to wear a mask when leaving their homes. Masks help to reduce the expulsion and transmission of droplets, which is the predominant route of transmission of COVID-19. It is therefore important for you to wear a mask, so that you will not spread the infection to others if you are infected. This is important even if you feel well, because you may be infected but asymptomatic.    It may be difficult for persons who are out in the community to avoid contact with others completely, including with infected persons who have very mild symptoms or may not show any symptoms. The wearing of masks is therefore an important precaution we can all take.    Everyone must wear a mask when outside of their homes. This applies on public transport, taxis, private hire cars, walking to or at markets, and also for permitted enterprise workers at all workplace premises, whether they are frontline staff (such as food handlers, cashiers and bus drivers) or performing back office functions (such as data entry personnel and payroll executives). Individuals may remove their mask while engaging in strenuous exercise outdoors (e.g. running/jogging), but they must put it back on after completing exercise."""

Vietnam,VNM,East_Asia_Pacific,20200926,H3: Contact tracing,2,.,2.,2.," Vietnamâs contact tracing strategy stands out as uniquely comprehensiveâit is based on tracing degrees of contact from F0 (the infected person) through F1 (those who have had close contact with F0 or are suspected of being infected), F2 (close contact with F1), and all the way up to F5.    The process in Vietnam worked as follows:   Once a patient with COVID-19 is identified (F0), local public health officials, with support from health professionals, security officers, the military, and other civil servants, work with the patient to identify who they might have been in contact with and infected in the past 14 days.  All close contacts (F1), defined as people who have been within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of or have prolonged contact of 30 or more minutes with a confirmed COVID-19 case, are identified by this process and tested for the virus. If F1s test positive for the virus, they are placed in isolation at a hospitalâall COVID-19 patients are hospitalized at no cost in Vietnam, regardless of symptoms. If F1s do not test positive, they are quarantined at a government-run quarantine center for 14 days. Close contacts of the previously identified close contacts (F2s) are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201008111546/https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-vietnam"
