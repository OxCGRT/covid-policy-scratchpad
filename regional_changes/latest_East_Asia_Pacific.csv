Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a U.N. meeting last week    https://web.archive.org/web/20201207184213/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/06/china-prepares-large-scale-rollout-of-coronavirus-vaccines-443159"
"125","China","CHN",2020-12-14,"East_Asia_Pacific","H7: Vaccination policy","0","0","This extended note aims to capture the progress on vaccination programme before it is rolled out to the entire country (does not include R&D, clinic trials).    The China National Medicine Products Administration (MPA) has not formally approved the Sinopharm Inactivated vaccine to go to the market. However, the green light is anticipated in the next few days.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214212000/https://weareunited.com.my/11515744/    On 24 June 2020, the MPA approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine. Voluntary vaccination started on around 17 June. The first batch of receivers consisted mainly of key workers, including state-owned enterprise employees who must go overseas to countries where the pandemic hits hard; medical staff, epidemic-control staff, border force and other essential workers who keep cities running.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231804/https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/cyxw/2020-11-18/doc-iiznezxs2537217.shtml    From mid-October, Zhejiang province has offered vaccines to ordinary citizens on a voluntary basis. The rationale has been that many cities in Zhejiang have export-oriented economies; for example, Yiwu city is the world centre for light industry commodity trading. Many wholesale merchants were keen on receiving vaccines so that they can travel to Latin America and Africa to inspect their businesses. See BBC reports below. By mid-November, Zhejiang had provided vaccines to some 743,000 people. Voluntary vaccines were paid by recipients. Two doses cost roughly 400 CNY plus a service charge of around 56 CNY, which altogether equals to approximately 70 USD.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231741/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-54628714    As the vaccination programme is yet to roll out to the whole country, there is no national policy on who will get the vaccine first. However, Sichuan province, where the most recent cluster of infection was found, did publish a detailed plan to that sets out the order:    The first group to receive vaccines consists of people facing high risks of infection, including medical staffs with International assistance mission, national health emergency rescue team in Sichuan, fever clinic and frontline doctors and nurses, border control force, frontline health inspection and epidemic-control officials, students or workers going overseas, police force, frozen food industry workers, essential workers for keeping cities running, teachers, other medical staffs, doctors and nurses, community social workers. The first batch is estimated to have 2 million people. Vaccination for them has started and will finish within 2020.    The second group to receive vaccines mainly consists of vulnerable people, including elderly people and people with chronic diseases. Vaccination for them will start from early next year (January).    The third batch will open to the general public. Ordinary people are estimated to start receiving vaccines after the Chinese New Year (12 February 2021).    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214221555/https://www.sohu.com/a/437018675_114988    So far, vaccination is not and is unlike to be paid by social medical insurance funds in the future. The National Health Security Administration has cited laws and regulations as the justification that vaccination is a part of public health effort, which should be shouldered by public finance resources, rather than social medical insurance funds.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214211226/https://www.sohu.com/a/425495553_114986    UAE and Bahrain have formally approved the Sinopharm vaccine on 9th and 13th December 2020 respectively.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231619/http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/09/c_1126842251.htm  http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231549/http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-12/14/c_1126855787.htm"

The details of how strict such restrictions are at any given moment are under-reported. Below are examples of the most strictest restrictions i could find from such PSBBs, which have now been extended:    Example 1: Oct 27 2020; Jakarta Post: ""Large-scale social restrictions in Bodebek, Jakarta extended""   Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20201101073623/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/27/large-scale-social-restrictions-in-bodebek-jakarta-extended.html    ""Depok city (in West Java province) is the region with the highest number of COVID-19 cases with a total of 6,858 patients. Depok is now also classified as a red zone after the national COVID-19 task force upgraded its status as a region with a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, the Depok administration will continue to impose a curfew for residents and business activities. With the curfew, residents’ activities cannot continue past 9 p.m., while businesses are allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. ""Dine-ins at restaurants and food stalls will only be allowed until 6 p.m., while take away service is until 9:00 p.m.,"" said Depok city COVID-19 task force spokesperson, Dadang Wihana.""

Businesses in the 11 essential sectors stipulated in Jakarta Governor Regulation No. 33 of 2020 on the Implementation of Large-Scale Social Restrictions to Handle the Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Jakarta (as amended) can remain open with minimum operation. These 11 essential sectors are as follows: a) health; b) food and beverages; c) energy; d) communication and informatics technology; e) financial; f) logistics; g) hotels; h) construction; i) strategic industries (not specifically defined, so the Jakarta Governor has the discretion to further stipulate it) j) essential services (pelayanan dasar), public utilities and certain industries that are categorized as national vital objects (obyek vital nasional) and certain objects (obyek tertentu); k) daily necessity supplies (kebutuhan sehari-hari)    3. Business actors that have obtained a non-essential exceptional operational license (izin pengecualian operasi bidang non-esensial) must re-obtain the license from the government of Jakarta.    4. All entertainment/recreation, including malls (except daily needs stores in the malls), museums, zoos and public parks will be closed.    5. Students will continue to learn from home as schools remain closed.    6. Restaurants and cafes can continue to operate, but only to serve take-away and delivery orders (no dine-in service).    7. Local places of worship (that only serve people in the neighborhood) can still operate, but with strict protocols and provided that they are not located in red zones. Big/renowned worship places (that serve people from all over Jakarta) must be closed.    8. Activities that can gather a crowd, e.g., reunions and large family gatherings, must not be held.    9. Public transportation will be limited (in the number of vehicles and the time). In Jakarta, the odd and even private cars restrictions will temporarily be stopped.    10. The governor of Jakarta urges people to stay at home and not leave Jakarta unless there is an urgent need. Further, the Jakarta government is coordinating with the central government and the neighboring regional governments, such as Banten, to discuss the limitation of vehicles going in and out of Jakarta."""

For the more stringent EMCO states, while measures may also vary by location, typical controls include the suspension of places of worship, and cultural, recreational, and sporting activities. Furthermore, the central government has designated areas recording more than 40 COVID-19 cases in the previous two weeks as red zones; such areas may see local restrictions. Central authorities may extend stricter curbs in some locations or expand the protocols to additional areas, depending on local COVID-19 activity.    Several state governments are maintaining additional statewide restrictions on top of those mandated by the central authorities. Some states may require businesses, such as hair salons and night markets, to remain closed.

Such travelers must comply with a controlled itinerary for the first 14 days and contact tracing measures. Additionally, in the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) scheme for long-term work visa holders, only people traveling to Johor State can quarantine at their residence or accommodations for seven days upon arrival, while those going to other Malaysian states must isolate at government-designated facilities for a week. Travelers can leave the quarantine sites upon testing negative for COVID-19.
