""""Safe management measures in schools will continue to include the following:    Screening    Twice-daily temperature-taking and visual screening for all students and staff.  Students and staff who are unwell, or who have household members on Home Quarantine Order/Stay Home Notice or have adult household members with flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, are required to stay away from school.  It is not mandatory for students to have their TraceTogether tokens when school reopens. The tokens will only be required in schools after nationwide distribution is completed.    Hygiene    Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and disinfection of the premises to be done daily.  Students will continue to practise frequent hand-washing throughout the school day and wipe down of tables and shared equipment after use.    Safe Distancing    Fixed group seating of up to eight from the same class will be allowed.  CCAs and external learning journeys of up to 50 people conducted in a fixed group with exclusive use of venues (if possible) are allowed.  Curricular, co-curricular and enrichment activities with fixed intermingling across schools are allowed.  Staggered arrival, dismissal and recess timings to reduce congestion.""""        Will all CCAs and school activities be resumed? [UPDATED, 18 Feb, 6:45pm]  Most CCAs and school activities are allowed to resume while activities that involve the following will remain suspended:    Trips to view external performances due to higher risk of intermingling with other schools and the public;  Activities with high level of body contact such as Taekwondo sparring, Rugby scrum and tackle;  Overnight camps.  Schools will continue to safeguard our students' well-being during CCAs and school activities, by implementing the necessary safe management measures (SMMs). This includes minimising prolonged inter-mingling between students and members of the public for activities held at external venues, such as Learning Journeys.    From SG Ministry of Education FAQs.
