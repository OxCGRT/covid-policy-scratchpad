It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).
