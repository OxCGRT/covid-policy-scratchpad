Vaccine differentiated measures have not imposed in schools.  Covid safety measures are currently still enforced in educational institutions.  _________________________    Quote (1):  ""Will Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) be introduced in schools and IHLs?  There are presently no plans to introduce VDS in our pre-schools, primary schools or SPED schools with primary/junior section. Our priority now is to ensure our children are well protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.    Similarly, COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for physical attendance in our secondary schools, SPED schools with secondary/senior sections, junior colleges and Millennia Institute. Access to quality education remains MOEâs priority. However, where there are public health reasons to better protect our students participating in higher risk activities, additional measures would be put in place. For example, unvaccinated students are required to perform a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) prior to participating in higher-risk activities such as singing and playing wind instruments. In addition, under the ongoing MCCY-MOE Team Sports Pilot for schools and IHLs, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an on-site ART self-swab are allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10.    From 1 February 2022, VDS will be expanded to include Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For now, VDS will only apply to all visitors who enter the IHLs. (IHL staff are already subject to VDS via MOMâs Workforce Vaccination Measures.) All students will be exempted from VDS. This exemption is subject to review.    To facilitate the safe resumption of in-person activities for IHL students, all unvaccinated students will be required to complete a weekly self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) regime to take part in higher risk activities on campus which require VDS, such as indoor unmasked activities or large-scale student events.    All staff in schools or IHLs are to adhere to the Workforce Vaccination Measures put in place by MOM.""      ""What are the arrangements for Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) for the resumption of term in 2022?  The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have increased the number of students allowed back on campus at any one time for face-to-face learning.    More student activities and large scale student events will resume in line with national guidelines on group sizes and event sizes.""

Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can now return to the workplace, an increase from the current limit of 50%. We will continue to align the rules for social gatherings in workplaces and other social settings, so long as the general group size and masking rules are adhered to.    d.    Safe Distancing.

A safe distance of 1 metre will continue to be required for mask-off settings. between individuals or between groups up to the prevailing group size limit.

The SMM 1-5 framework consists of five key parameters: (i) group sizes; (ii) mask-wearing; (iii) workplace requirements; (iv) safe distancing; and (v) capacity limits. As the local situation has improved considerably, we will ease the community SMMs along these five parameters.  From 29 March 2022, we will implement the following adjustments (see Annex A for more details):  a.    Group Sizes. The permissible group size for social gatherings will be increased from 5 persons to 10 persons for mask-off activities. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will also be adjusted from 5 persons at any one time, to 10 persons at any one time.  b.    Mask-Wearing. Mask-wearing will continue to be required for indoor settings when people leave their homes, but will be optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas. Indoor places refer to all buildings/places with clearly defined entrances/exits, such as office buildings, shopping malls, public transport (i.e. when commuting in trains and buses), and includes hawker centres and coffeeshops. Places which are sheltered but with open access generally, such as Housing Development Board (HDB) void decks, retail block walkways, bus stops, and naturally ventilated bus interchanges will be regarded as outdoor areas. See Annex B for more examples.  c.     Workplace Requirements. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can now return to the workplace, an increase from the current limit of 50%. We will continue to align the rules for social gatherings in workplaces and other social settings, so long as the general group size and masking rules are adhered to.  d.    Safe Distancing. Safe distancing continues to be encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups for mask-on settings. A safe distance of 1 metre will continue to be required for mask-off settings. between individuals or between groups up to the prevailing group size limit. Notwithstanding this, we still need to guard against gatherings of big crowds, even if they have their masks on. Hence, we will continue to impose capacity limits, as described below.  e.    Capacity Limits. The capacity limit of 50% for large events and settings of more than 1,000 pax1 will be increased to 75%. This means that:    i.     For smaller settings/events with =1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit.   ii.     For larger settings/events with >1,000 pax and that are mask-on2, they will be subject to operating within 75% of the capacity limit of the venue. For mask-off events, individuals or groups of individuals up to the prevailing group size will be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement.    Other Activity-Specific Adjustments  7.             In line with the above easing under the SMM 1-5 framework, we will also make the following activity-specific adjustments from 29 March 2022.  8.             Dine-in at food and beverage (F&B) establishments. In line with the increase in group size, groups of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops, where full vaccination-differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks have been implemented at their entrances. To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, we will allow all F&B establishments to seat smaller groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons, without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance. Instead, random spot-checks will be done to ensure that only vaccinated persons are dining-in at these places, and the onus will be on the dining-in individuals to abide by the rules. This will make it easier for the F&B operators who face difficulties in cordoning off their venues and setting up discrete access control points especially hawker centres and coffee-shops.  9.             Alcohol consumption. The current restriction, in F&B establishments, on the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm will be lifted.  10.          Live performances and screening of programmes. Live performances will be allowed to resume at all venues, including F&B establishments. Outdoor live performances and busking3 will also be allowed to resume.  Groups that are involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing SMM 1-5, i.e. keep to the group size of 10 unmasked persons. We will also lift the restriction on the screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments.  11.          Vocalisation activities. We had previously taken a strong position against group vocalisation activities because of the higher risk of transmission. But we are now in a different situation and can start easing this restriction. Subject to masks being worn throughout the vocalisation activity, we will allow the following activities which involve vocalisation by large groups:  a.    Congregational singing and chanting;  b.    Cheering by audiences/spectators/participants at events; and  c.     Singing in general settings, including in schools.  12.          Social events and larger-scale social gatherings. Except for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions, which are key life events, we have held back from allowing larger-scale social gatherings and events such as gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events (D&Ds), birthday celebrations and anniversaries.  Given the stabilising local situation and for consistency with other events, we will allow such social events and gatherings to resume. Organisers of these events should still comply the prevailing SMM 1-5. That means there should be no more than 10 persons per table, and safe distancing of 1 m maintained between tables. Participants should also continue to exercise prudence and restraint, and limit their interactions to the same group they are seated with.  13.          The above changes will all take effect from 29 March 2022. The relevant agencies will provide more details on any further detailed requirements specific to their sectors.  14.          We are separately looking into the safe resumption of nightlife businesses, comprising bars, pubs, karaoke establishments, discotheques and nightclubs. These are activities with much higher risks of transmission and where there are generally more difficulties complying with the prevailing SMM 1-5. MTI and MHA will provide an update on the re-opening of the sector in the coming weeks.""

Over the past few months, we have simplified our country/region classification and border measures to pave the way for more Vaccinated Travel. With many countries/regions having passed the peak of their Omicron wave and our local COVID-19 situation stabilising, we are ready to launch the Vaccinated Travel Framework for all travellers including Short-Term Visitors (STVs). We will classify all countries/regions either under the General Travel or the Restricted Category and accord border measures by individual travellersâ vaccination status. All countries/regions will come under the General Travel Category to begin with. There are no countries/regions in the Restricted Category currently.    General Travel Category Border Measures  22.          From 31 March 2022, 2359 hours, the border measures for travellers arriving via air or sea checkpoints from countries/regions in the General Travel Category will be as follows:  a.    All fully vaccinated travellers5 and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below6 are permitted to enter Singapore. They will not need to apply for entry approvals or take designated VTL transport. They will continue to be subjected to a pre-departure test (PDT) within 2 days before departure for Singapore, but will no longer be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or undergo an unsupervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) after arriving in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situations and consider removing the PDT requirement in the coming weeks;  b.    Non-fully vaccinated Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) and STVs aged 13 and above are generally not allowed to enter Singapore, with the following exceptions (i) LTPHs medically ineligible for vaccines ; (ii) LTPHs aged 13 to 17, subject to the appropriate measures7 and (iii) LTPHs and STVs with other valid entry approval (e.g. for compassionate reasons). They are required to take a PDT within 2 days before departure for Singapore, undergo a 7-day SHN, and take a PCR test at the end of their SHN period.   23.          To facilitate Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs), Work Pass Holders and other LTPHs who may face difficulties obtaining valid PDTs within 2 days before returning to Singapore, we have introduced remote supervised ART services by approved licensed providers in Singapore for such travellers arriving from selected countries. Going forward, we will accept Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, professionally administered ARTs and ARTs supervised by approved licensed providers in Singapore (including remotely supervised ARTs) taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore as valid PDTs. Travellers who wish to use the remotely supervised ART PDT services licensed in Singapore should book their slots early with these providers via their respective websites and bring along approved ART kits from Singapore for their remotely supervised ART. Refer to https://go.gov.sg/remote-art-overseas-sg for a list of approved remotely supervised ART PDT providers, and the travellers and countries/regions that this service applies to.  24.          We are also working towards the full resumption of land travel with Malaysia for fully vaccinated persons. Details on the exact border measures for fully vaccinated travellers entering Singapore via the land borders will be announced jointly with Malaysia.    Restricted Category Border Measures  25.          In the event of a new variant with potentially significant public health risk, we may re-classify significantly affected countries/regions under the Restricted Category with stringent border measures, such as the need for entry approvals for STVs to enter Singapore. This is to enable us to limit the risk of importing new and potentially dangerous variants if they arise, as well as to buy time for experts to better understand the characteristics of these variants and to develop appropriate public health recommendations.8  26.          See Annex E for details on the border measures for travellers arriving from 31 March 2022, 2359 hours. The latest border requirements can be found on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are strongly advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures before entering Singapore, and be prepared to adhere to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore.

Quote (1):  ""The suspension of in-person visits to all hospital wards1 and  residential care homes will be extended from 20 March to 3 April 2022 (both dates inclusive).   During this period, hospitals and homes can make assessments on a case-by-case basis to allow in-person visits for exceptional cases.      Pre-visit testing requirements at hospitals and homes  Visitors who are allowed into hospital wards and homes will be required to show a valid negative ART result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit. All tests are to be self-funded by the visitor. This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2.  Fully vaccinated or medically ineligible visitors can perform an unsupervised self-administered ART or opt for an ART administered by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres) to fulfil the pre-visit testing requirement. They will be required to show evidence of a valid ART result, e.g. present a time-stamped photo of the dated ART result and photo ID for verification prior to entry.  Non-fully vaccinated visitors would be required to show results of ART  administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including  Quick Test Centres). Results from unsupervised self-administered ART will not be  accepted for this group of visitors.  In-person visits at hospitals    The following patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospitals:   Patients who are in critical condition;    Paediatric patients;   Birthing/post-partum mothers; and    Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples of caregivers include those providing assistance to inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.    The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patientâs bedside at any one time.   All visitors approved to enter hospital wards must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or use the patientsâ toilets in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ beds.  In-situ recovery for some nursing home residents   From 16 February 2022, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will progressively support nursing homes to care for their fully-vaccinated residents who have been infected but have mild or no symptoms within their premises. These residents will be isolated from the other uninfected residents.   Infected residents who are assessed to be at higher risk, or who show signs of clinical deterioration will continue to be conveyed to an appropriate care facility for recovery.      1Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals   2 Recovered individuals (within last 180 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic  offering ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing services.""
