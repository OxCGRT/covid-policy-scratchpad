""Government has decided to further extend the lockdown period on the islands of North Tarawa, Maiana, Abaiang, Marakei and Abemama for another two more weeks or may be longer should the need arise and with different conditions due to the slow in spread of the diseases on these islands, effective from Friday 18th of February 2022. The islands of Aranuka and Makin who have just affected with the spread of COVID-19 will also be included among these islands.    Subsequent to the decision pertaining to this extension, there are also new decisions put in place in addition to the current measures under the Alert Level 3. These new measures which will only apply on North Tarawa, Maiana, Abaiang, Marakei and Abemama, including  Aranuka and Makin are as follows:  7. Public transportation services may operate but will also observe compulsory face mask, open windows, no spitting and nose blowing, and other MHMS guidelines and passengers must not share seats nor stand.  13. No travels between the outer islands are allowed.  19. The non-affected islands with COVID-19 will continue their operations as usual.    http://archive.today/7Q8G0"

""The Ministry of Health and Medical Services also clarifies that a report on the declining low positive cases today is associated with the low number of people visiting clinics for tests yesterday, Sunday 13th of February 2022.  This is also experienced in many countries as clinics normally receive low number of cases on Monday after only a few people come for testing on Sunday.  Moreover, clinics also report that many people are still symptomatic but do not turn up to be tested as they only follow the MHMS guidance to stay at home and monitor their symptoms.    In light of this, the Government appeals to the general public for stronger support and cooperation to assist in mitigating the spread of the virus in the country and encourage them to get tested at clinics to be able to know their status.  With this information, they will be able to protect their loved ones by staying isolated at home and following SOPs until their infectious stage is over.   This will greatly reduce the spread of the virus.""    http://archive.today/2022.02.14-191313/https://www.facebook.com/ob.gov.ki/posts/257856156522930"

CTCs provide both the self-paid Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test.    Click here for the locations of CTCs.  About Quick Test Centres (QTCs)  Quick Test Centres (QTCs) provide self-paid ART, where the test will be self-administered and supervised by an approved COVID-19 test provider. The test will cost $15 (inclusive of GST), with payment to be made at the QTCs through cashless modes, such as Mastercard, NETS, PayNow and Visa. Individuals will need to bring along their photo identification for verification at the QTC.    Both the CTCs and QTCs are important as they support COVID-19 testing, which helps to keep our homes and communities safe, especially as we re-open and resume our activities.    Click here for the locations of QTCs CTCs.""
