Level 3 is a relaxation of COVID restrictions made of of a combination of layered safety measures allowing student and staff wellness while keeping schools open. This provision has allowed for more school activities including dancing and some music classes, school sports, and now fully vaccinated visitors being allowed on site to support curriculum delivery, wellbeing programs and school operations.    Continuing 25 October policy is still in place where schools of all grades have returned to face-to-face learning either through a âstaged returnâ or âfull returnâ, depending on health conditions in their area. Now in areas where 75% of the eligible population over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated, students in kindergarten, years 1 and 12 return to in-person teaching. While in indoor settings in schools, masks or face coverings are required for all staff and all students in Year 7 and above. Masks are strongly recommended for primary students.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119173807/https://education.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/advice-for-families"

As a pre-emptive measure in preparations for countering against a sixth wave of infection, free PCR and antigen testing have become available for asymptomatic individuals.    Despite the announcement we cannot find any firm dates when the policy comes in to force. Should dates become clearer at a leter date we will adjust the policy accordingly.    Kishida announced Friday that, while new cases are rising, individuals who canât be vaccinated for health reasons and who donât have symptoms but are concerned they have been infected can receive a PCR or antigen test before taking part in certain economic or social activities.    The plan is part of a greater effort to prepare the country for a sixth wave of the pandemic â and whatever comes afterwards â by bolstering hospitals, procuring more medical staff, expanding its vaccine campaign, administering booster shots and advancing the treatment of those with COVID-19.    âWhile new cases have declined substantially, itâs important to acknowledge the strong possibility that the virus will return and to prepare accordingly,â Kishida said Friday.    Itâs not exactly clear who will be eligible and under what circumstances, but Kishida said Friday that the decision will be left to local governments, who have been directed to execute the plan at the latest by the end of March 2022.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211114022125/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/12/national/covid19-policies-free-testing/    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050612/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/20211107-OYT1T50148/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050745/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/469112  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119042821/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211115/k10013349111000.html (logistics for free asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211112050813/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211108/k10013339271000.html (considerations for asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050557/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00132.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119045214/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00004.html"

Despite rising global caution regarding the new variant, Omicron, singapore has maintained open borders for now, instead of closing or banning travelers from specific countries, the government has taken on a more intensive approach with targeted testing, isolation and deferment of VTLs until further notice.  ________________________    Quote (1):  ""Deferment of Vaccinated Travel Lanes with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE  2.

On 26 November 2021, the WHO classified a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, known as Omicron (B.1.1.529), as a variant of concern. Scientists around the world are presently working to determine the characteristics of the new Omicron variant, such as whether it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, and if it is more likely to lead to severe illnesses. Singapore has not detected any cases of this variant to date.   4.     As a precautionary move to reduce the risks of importation and spread of the Omicron variant to Singapore, we will be deferring the commencement of the VTLs for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE until further notice. This is in view of their proximity as transport nodes to the affected countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe1. We will provide more details on the commencement of these VTLs at a later date.    Regular Review of Border Measures  5.

Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

In response to the emergence of a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, which has since been termed the Omicron variant, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 26 November 2021 travel restrictions for affected countries/regions[1]. On 28 November 2021, we further deferred the launch of the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with countries that serve as transport nodes to the affected countries/regions[2]. These measures will help to reduce the risk of importation of the Omicron variant.""    ""On-arrival PCR Test for All Travellers and Additional Antigen Rapid Tests for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes  5.     To step up detection and containment of the Omicron variant until more information is available, we will enhance our testing protocols for travellers arriving in Singapore after 2 December 2021, 2359 hours (Singapore time) (details in Annex A). These enhanced measures will apply for four weeks in the first instance, and will be reviewed and extended if necessary.  6.     All travellers entering or transferring/transiting through Singapore, after 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), including travellers from Category I countries/regions, must undergo a Pre-Departure Test (PDT)[3] within 2 days of their departure for Singapore and obtain a negative result. All travellers entering Singapore, including travellers from Category II (non-Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)), III and IV countries, must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test on-arrival[4].  7.     With effect from 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), air travellers on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL-Air) [5] who arrived after the cut-off date and time, will also have to undergo additional supervised self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) at a Quick Test Centre on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival. These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.     We are also conducting a one-time surveillance PCR testing exercise for travellers who arrived between 12 and 27 November 2021 and had travelled to the countries/regions affected by Omicron[1] in the 14 days before their arrival in Singapore. These travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue. We seek the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise.    PCR RRT for Affected Border Frontline Workers  9.     Our borders are the first line of defence against importation of the Omicron variant. Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly.

The stabilisation phase, which started on Sep 27 to help reduce the strain on the healthcare system, was scheduled to last until Oct 24.   It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).
