In the second phase, said the minister, in-person lessons will be carried out five times a week for students who have completed two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and the increased school capacity from 40 to 100 per cent. This is to be implemented for secondary school students from Year 7 to 11, including special need students in Priority Level 1 and 2. Those in Priority Level 3 will have to attend their physical classes thrice a week, and Year 12 and 13 students, including special needs in Priority Level 1 and 2. Classes for special needs students in Priority Level 3 will be carried out thrice a week.     Lessons for students aged 5 to 11 who have yet to receive their vaccination will continue via online and HLP.     âStudents who continue to have difficulties with online learning will be continued to be supported by the school through the provision of HLPâ, the minister stated. ""    Additionally, from the frst Scoop report,   ""Only fully vaccinated teachers and students can return to primary and secondary schools, sixth form centres and higher education institutions.    Some 98 percent of teachers are fully jabbed while 80 percent of students aged 12-17 have received two vaccine doses, according to education ministry figures.    All double-vaxxed students, teachers and non-teaching staff are still required to undergo antigen rapid tests once a week in the first stage of school reopening.""    â    ""Toddlers aged 3 to 4 can head back to kindergartens from January 17, the education minister said Wednesday.    Joining the COVID-19 news conference, Dato Hj Hamzah Hj Sulaiman said in-person lessons will be allowed for preschoolers five times a week, but attendance at kindergartens is capped at 30 percent.    To ensure the safety of preschoolers who are not authorised to receive the vaccine against COVID, only kindergartens that meet health requirements can reopen.    Kindergarten pupils will also be required to wear face masks and undergo antigen rapid tests once a week, with only those producing negative results permitted to attend in-person classes.    The minister said parents and guardians of the children must be fully jabbed and show proof of vaccination.    Double-vaccinated Year 7-9 pupils will also return to classrooms next week after a five-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, joining Year 10-13 students who were the first group to resume face-to-face classes earlier this month.""

Under current rules, unvaccinated individuals can get a PET and show a negative test result to enter a VDS setting. We will remove this concession for unvaccinated individuals to perform PET in lieu of being fully vaccinated.  Hence, only fully vaccinated, recovered, or medically ineligible individuals, or children aged 12 years and below (subject to venue/event-specific caps) will be allowed to enter settings where VDS is implemented. We will effect this on 1 January 2022, to allow time for more individuals to complete their primary series vaccination regime.

Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily through the respiratory droplets of infected people, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. These respiratory droplets can reach the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person directly or indirectly (via contaminated surfaces), resulting in infection.    Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.    To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing. Individuals should also observe good hand hygiene and avoid crowded spaces if possible.""    Link (1): http://web.archive.org/web/20211119095432/https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/general"

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community. This has bought time for us to booster vaccinate more residents, learn more about the Omicron variant and make necessary adjustments to our COVID-19 strategy. As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now. We will continue to review the local and global COVID-19 situation and adjust our measures accordingly.    Facilitating Travel for Recently-Recovered Travellers    28.    With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas. See Annex D for the list of documentation to be presented by such travellers at check-in and arrival immigration to qualify for this exemption.""

From the 24 of January, all in-persons will be suspended for 4 weeks until 20 February 2022 in light of the current omicron wave in Singapore.  _________________    Quote (1):  ""[Updated 21 January 2022]    To better protect our patients and healthcare workers, particularly in settings with vulnerable persons, in-person visits to all hospital wards1 and residential care homes will be suspended for a period of four weeks, from 24 January to 20 February 2022 (both dates inclusive).    During this period, hospitals and homes can make assessments on a case-by-case basis to allow in-person visits for exceptional cases. More details for visits to hospitals and homes can be found below.    Pre-visit testing requirements at hospitals and homes    Visitors who are allowed into hospital wards and homes will be required to show a valid negative ART result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit. All tests are to be self-funded by the visitor. This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2.   Fully vaccinated or medically ineligible visitors can perform an unsupervised self-administered ART or opt for an ART administered by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres) to fulfil the pre-visit testing requirement. Those who opt to undergo unsupervised self-administered ART will be required to show evidence of a valid ART result, e.g. present a time-stamped photo of the dated ART result and photo ID for verification prior to entry.  Non-fully vaccinated visitors would be required to show results of ART administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including Quick Test Centres). Results from unsupervised self-administered ART will not be accepted for this group of visitors.    In-person visits at hospitals  The following patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospitals:   a. Patients who are in critical condition;    b. Paediatric patients;   c. Birthing/post-partum mothers; and    d. Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples of caregivers include those providing assistance to inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better  care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.      The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patientâs bedside at any one time.  All visitors approved to enter hospital wards must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or use the patientsâ toilets in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patientsâ beds.    1Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals   2 Recovered individuals (within last 180 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic  offering ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing services.""

Evidence of high daily case numbers and widespread, ongoing community transmission nationwide, that might render comprehensive contact tracing both impossible and less useful as a disease control measure as opposed to in earlier stages of the pandemic.      Thailand has been recording around 7,000+ new infections/day (as confirmed by a PCR test) for the period of 18â24 Jan 2022.     1.

Recent government guidelines state that people who discover they have Covid-19 after testing with home ATKs (antigen test kits) must report their result to the authorities, get it confirmed with a PCR test and undergo isolation. However, those with mild or no symptoms are asked to self-isolate at home in order âto ease the burden on the public health care system.â     https://archive.vn/oxD9a â Thaiger: âThailandâs updated Covid guidelines: What to do if you test positive or have symptoms.â     C.	Government strategy seems to have also shifted to making home Covid-19 tests widely available for people so they can find out if they should take a PCR test and self-isolate, and utilising vaccinations. By comparison, there does not seem to be much mention of tracing the contacts of all known cases. Nonetheless, the possibility that some contact tracing may still be going on in targeted areas is not discounted.     https://archive.vn/rvnUw â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Twitter post on making antigen kits available at low cost in response to high demand.    https://archive.vn/VEGGV and  https://archive.vn/X2JMF â Thai Government Public Relations Department, Facebook posts encouraging vaccinations.

Recent mentions of contact tracing usually refer to contact tracing apps. Thai authorities have encouraged everyone to download Mor Chana and Thai Chana, Thailandâs contact tracing apps. However, this by itself does not amount to manual, comprehensive contact tracing carried out by the authorities.
