Fully vaccinated individuals may travel from Brunei to Singapore without quarantine on dedicated Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flights. Travelers must have remained in Brunei or any other VTL country within the last 14 days, undergo pre-departure testing, and self-isolate until negative results of an on-arrival test arrive.

Individual risk is dependent on exposure. Everyone in our community can take steps now to prepare for this emerging public health threat by doing everyday preventative measures:  Itâs currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. However, if soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and nose with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Practice proper cough etiquette â cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects or surfaces.  Stay home when you are sick â do not go to work or school.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211203202734/https://www.grta.guam.gov/precautionary-measures-department-public-health"

As a pre-emptive measure in preparations for countering against a sixth wave of infection, free PCR and antigen testing have become available for asymptomatic individuals.    Despite the announcement we cannot find any firm dates when the policy comes in to force. Should dates become clearer at a leter date we will adjust the policy accordingly.    Kishida announced Friday that, while new cases are rising, individuals who canât be vaccinated for health reasons and who donât have symptoms but are concerned they have been infected can receive a PCR or antigen test before taking part in certain economic or social activities.    The plan is part of a greater effort to prepare the country for a sixth wave of the pandemic â and whatever comes afterwards â by bolstering hospitals, procuring more medical staff, expanding its vaccine campaign, administering booster shots and advancing the treatment of those with COVID-19.    âWhile new cases have declined substantially, itâs important to acknowledge the strong possibility that the virus will return and to prepare accordingly,â Kishida said Friday.    Itâs not exactly clear who will be eligible and under what circumstances, but Kishida said Friday that the decision will be left to local governments, who have been directed to execute the plan at the latest by the end of March 2022.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211114022125/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/12/national/covid19-policies-free-testing/    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050612/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/20211107-OYT1T50148/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050745/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/469112  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119042821/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211115/k10013349111000.html (logistics for free asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211112050813/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211108/k10013339271000.html (considerations for asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050557/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00132.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119045214/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00004.html"

""On-arrival PCR Test for All Travellers and Additional Antigen Rapid Tests for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes  5.     To step up detection and containment of the Omicron variant until more information is available, we will enhance our testing protocols for travellers arriving in Singapore after 2 December 2021, 2359 hours (Singapore time) (details in Annex A). These enhanced measures will apply for four weeks in the first instance, and will be reviewed and extended if necessary.  6.     All travellers entering or transferring/transiting through Singapore, after 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), including travellers from Category I countries/regions, must undergo a Pre-Departure Test (PDT)[3] within 2 days of their departure for Singapore and obtain a negative result. All travellers entering Singapore, including travellers from Category II (non-Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)), III and IV countries, must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test on-arrival[4].  7.     With effect from 2 December, 2359 hours (Singapore time), air travellers on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL-Air) [5] who arrived after the cut-off date and time, will also have to undergo additional supervised self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) at a Quick Test Centre on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival. These measures will enable us to minimise importation and allow prompt detection and isolation of Omicron cases.    One-off Surveillance Testing Exercise for Travellers who Arrived from Affected Countries/Regions in Past Two Weeks  8.     We are also conducting a one-time surveillance PCR testing exercise for travellers who arrived between 12 and 27 November 2021 and had travelled to the countries/regions affected by Omicron[1] in the 14 days before their arrival in Singapore. These travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue. We seek the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise.    PCR RRT for Affected Border Frontline Workers  9.     Our borders are the first line of defence against importation of the Omicron variant. Hence, as a precautionary measure, from 2 December 2021 we will revert to a weekly PCR Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for airport and other border frontline workers who may come into contact with travellers from countries/regions affected by the Omicron variant. A PCR-based test will facilitate the detection of the Omicron variant.  10.     For aircrew serving flights from these countries, they will be subjected to an on-arrival PCR test, and post-arrival PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 following each flight duty. Other airport and border frontline workers will continue with ART-based RRT. As an added precaution, such individuals presenting a positive ART will have to go for a confirmatory PCR test. All border frontline workers, including recovered persons, will need to undergo the RRT. This will allow us to better detect potential cases infected with the Omicron variant at our border in a timely manner.    Enhanced Management of Confirmed and Suspected Omicron cases  11.     Cases confirmed or suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery, and instead be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management. We will also conduct full contact tracing for these cases to identify their close contacts, place them on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities instead of allowing self-isolation at home, and conduct PCR testing at the start and at the end of their quarantine.    Update on Travel Advisory  12.     All residents of Singapore are advised to defer all travel to higher risk countries/regions, that include Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe until further notice. In addition, we encourage travellers who visit countries/regions with reported cases of the Omicron variant or countries with high traffic volume to these higher risk countries/regions to take extra precaution, including wearing masks, and observing good personal hygiene and SMMs even if these requirements are not required there. This will protect you during this period of uncertainty.    Maintaining Vigilance Against New Variant  13.     We are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community. We will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly.

Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected  COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID19 infection. A suspected COVID-19 infection is linked to travel in areas where cases have  been reported, or close contact with someone who has travelled in these areas and has become  ill.  The use of masks is crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone (at  home or in a health care facility).  Effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are frequently clean your  hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1  meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.   https://web.archive.org/web/20211126103746/https://solomons.gov.sb/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-FAQS-FINAL-1.pdf"
