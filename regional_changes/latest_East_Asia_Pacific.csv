This is also experienced in many countries as clinics normally receive low number of cases on Monday after only a few people come for testing on Sunday.  Moreover, clinics also report that many people are still symptomatic but do not turn up to be tested as they only follow the MHMS guidance to stay at home and monitor their symptoms.    In light of this, the Government appeals to the general public for stronger support and cooperation to assist in mitigating the spread of the virus in the country and encourage them to get tested at clinics to be able to know their status.

Vaccine differentiated measures have not imposed in schools.  Covid safety measures are currently still enforced in educational institutions.  _________________________    Quote (1):  ""Will Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) be introduced in schools and IHLs?  There are presently no plans to introduce VDS in our pre-schools, primary schools or SPED schools with primary/junior section. Our priority now is to ensure our children are well protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.    Similarly, COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for physical attendance in our secondary schools, SPED schools with secondary/senior sections, junior colleges and Millennia Institute. Access to quality education remains MOEâs priority. However, where there are public health reasons to better protect our students participating in higher risk activities, additional measures would be put in place. For example, unvaccinated students are required to perform a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) prior to participating in higher-risk activities such as singing and playing wind instruments. In addition, under the ongoing MCCY-MOE Team Sports Pilot for schools and IHLs, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an on-site ART self-swab are allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10.    From 1 February 2022, VDS will be expanded to include Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For now, VDS will only apply to all visitors who enter the IHLs. (IHL staff are already subject to VDS via MOMâs Workforce Vaccination Measures.) All students will be exempted from VDS. This exemption is subject to review.    To facilitate the safe resumption of in-person activities for IHL students, all unvaccinated students will be required to complete a weekly self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) regime to take part in higher risk activities on campus which require VDS, such as indoor unmasked activities or large-scale student events.

Vaccine differentiated measures have not imposed in schools.  Covid safety measures are currently still enforced in educational institutions.  _________________________    Quote (1):  ""Will Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) be introduced in schools and IHLs?  There are presently no plans to introduce VDS in our pre-schools, primary schools or SPED schools with primary/junior section. Our priority now is to ensure our children are well protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.    Similarly, COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for physical attendance in our secondary schools, SPED schools with secondary/senior sections, junior colleges and Millennia Institute. Access to quality education remains MOEâs priority. However, where there are public health reasons to better protect our students participating in higher risk activities, additional measures would be put in place. For example, unvaccinated students are required to perform a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) prior to participating in higher-risk activities such as singing and playing wind instruments. In addition, under the ongoing MCCY-MOE Team Sports Pilot for schools and IHLs, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an on-site ART self-swab are allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10.    From 1 February 2022, VDS will be expanded to include Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For now, VDS will only apply to all visitors who enter the IHLs. (IHL staff are already subject to VDS via MOMâs Workforce Vaccination Measures.) All students will be exempted from VDS. This exemption is subject to review.    To facilitate the safe resumption of in-person activities for IHL students, all unvaccinated students will be required to complete a weekly self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) regime to take part in higher risk activities on campus which require VDS, such as indoor unmasked activities or large-scale student events.    All staff in schools or IHLs are to adhere to the Workforce Vaccination Measures put in place by MOM.""      ""What are the arrangements for Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) for the resumption of term in 2022?

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community. This has bought time for us to booster vaccinate more residents, learn more about the Omicron variant and make necessary adjustments to our COVID-19 strategy. As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now. We will continue to review the local and global COVID-19 situation and adjust our measures accordingly.    Facilitating Travel for Recently-Recovered Travellers    28.    With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas. See Annex D for the list of documentation to be presented by such travellers at check-in and arrival immigration to qualify for this exemption.""

On 31 December 2021, we announced a four-week extension to the enhanced 7- day testing regime for travellers arriving via VTLs in order to facilitate the detection of imported Omicron cases and slow transmission into the community. This has bought time for us to booster vaccinate more residents, learn more about the Omicron variant and make necessary adjustments to our COVID-19 strategy. As imported cases now form a shrinking proportion of our overall cases, we will simplify the VTL testing regime.    25.     These measures are less relevant now. Hence, VTL travellers entering Singapore after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours via both air and land checkpoints will only be required to do unsupervised self-administered ARTs from Day 2 to Day 7 of their arrivals if they need to leave their place of residence or accommodation. Travellers need not submit their ART results but must test negative before going out. VTL travellers who arrive before 23 January 2022, 2359 hours are still required to continue with the existing testing regime (i.e. unsupervised self-administered ART on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 with submission of results online, and supervised ART on Days 3 and 7 from their arrival).    26.    Travellers who test positive on ARTs (i.e. the on-arrival test for VTL-Land and unsupervised self-administered ARTs on Days 2 to 7) no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test, but should instead simply recover under Protocol 2.2 That said, those who identify themselves as potentially at risk (as stipulated in Annex C) should visit a doctor for medical advice after testing positive even if they feel well.    27.     We will continue to maintain a 50% limit on VTL flight and bus tickets for entry into Singapore for now. We will continue to review the local and global COVID-19 situation and adjust our measures accordingly.    Facilitating Travel for Recently-Recovered Travellers    28.    With the growing number of cases worldwide, there is a rise in the number of travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19. Such travellers can continue to shed non-infectious viral fragments even after they have recovered, and therefore test positive for COVID-19 despite posing no infection risk. As fully vaccinated individuals who recently recovered from infection have a high level of immunity through their recent COVID-19 infection and vaccination, the likelihood of reinfection is low.    29.     Hence, travellers arriving after 23 January 2022, 2359 hours who are fully vaccinated and recently recovered (i.e. within 90 days of their last infection) will be exempted from all testing and SHN requirements if they are able to provide appropriate documentary proof. Non-fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers will be exempted from pre-departure testing requirements, but will still be subjected to all other prevailing border measures. This will facilitate the safe return of recently-recovered residents who travel overseas. See Annex D for the list of documentation to be presented by such travellers at check-in and arrival immigration to qualify for this exemption.""

Present testing policy: lateral flow/rapid antigen tests are available to be purchased at subsidised prices. The government has also distributed some tests for free. Anyone who tests positive on a rapid test is supposed to report it and obtain a PCR test (administered by a health worker) to confirm the result.     Free PCR tests are also being offered to Thai citizens and foreign travellers who require it under the Test & Go scheme, regardless of symptoms.     Additional notes: However, there have been difficulties caused by the shortage of rapid test kits, due to the spread of Omicron increasing demand. Such shortages could impact access to PCR tests, since a positive lateral test is the gateway to getting a PCR test.     Archived source:   1.
