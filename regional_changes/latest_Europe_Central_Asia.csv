The Government of Andorra is therefore currently applying no restrictions on entering the country, nor on the movement of people and vehicles around its territory.    Everyone travelling to Andorra is exempt from having to complete a period of quarantine on arrival there.    •	From 9 December, the Government of Andorra has decreed that all tourists who spend 3 or more nights in the country and who are over 6 years of age, will be asked to prove they have tested negative (in a PCR or TMA) in the 72 hours before they arrive in Andorra. Admission to tourist accommodation will therefore also be conditional upon showing a negative result.    The supporting document must be the original, it can be written in Catalan, Spanish, French and/or English and can be submitted either in paper or electronic format. The document must contain at least the following information: the name of the tourist, their passport or identity card number (which must match the one used in their travel documents), the date on which the test was carried out, the identification and contact details of the centre which carried out the analysis, the test technique used and its negative result.     •	Visitors coming from France, Spain and Portugal are exempt from submitting a test due to the health agreements between Andorra and these countries. Similarly, tourists coming from countries considered as being in the ‘green zone’, or from countries whose test ratio for the population of their territory is greater than 5,000 tests carried out per 100,000 inhabitants per week or with less than 9% of their total number of tests being positive, will also be exempt.     •	However, residents of Spain, France or Portugal are advised to obtain a travel document from their Social Security office. People of other nationalities are advised to take out private travel insurance to provide coverage against COVID-19 or other possible incidents during their stay in Andorra.    https://archive.vn/0a76u    It is worth noting that in effect travel restrictions in place in France and Spain determine who can travel to Andorra, since all travel into Andorra requires transit via neighbouring France or Spain.  https://archive.vn/ybv4u"

A fact that will reinforce the control and management of the epidemiological situation and that at the same time will favour the move from a strategy of total confinement to one of selective confinement of the people infected by the coronavirus and his contacts. In this way, the protection of the most vulnerable citizens is enhanced and at the same time minimizes the probability of contagion in the work and school environment. The tests, consisting of a practically painless finger prick, will be performed free of charge to everyone.  There will be two tests to all citizens in two waves, separated by fifteen days, being the final result of the test the sum of the two tests. That is, two tests that offer a single result. In this sense, people who test positive in the first analysis of antibodies will be warned and isolated in order to take a PCR test and check if they have the disease at that time. The rest of the citizens, after the first test, will receive instructions on what to do and will obtain a final result when both tests have been done.  https://archive.vn/O1yU0"

Short-time work supports companies in order to keep as many employees as possible in the company, even in times of financial crisis.

In general, support can only be given to companies that have been severely affected by the current corona crisis and have thus got into a critical financial situation.    80-90% of the salary will be covered during short-time work.    The Corona short-time work is currently limited to a duration of 3 months. This time frame can later be extended by a further 3 months.    In principle, all employees subject to unemployment insurance are eligible for short-time work, provided they have a fully paid calendar month before starting short-time work.

The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Depending on how long and intensive the contact was with this person, one is identified as contact person K1 or K2.

The moratorium will be automatically extended, only those who want to repay their loan despite the moratorium will have to visit their bank, the Prime Minister said.  It also announced that businesses forced to close temporarily as a a cause of disease measures would be supported by the government in December and January by waived and taking over two-thirds of wage costs. In addition to catering, hotels and tourism, the remission of contributions and wage subsidies will be extended to private bus companies that are forced to take a break.  Viktor Orban also said that business taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises and sole proprietors will be cut by half from 1 January. These businesses account for the most jobs and are the most vulnerable during the epidemic, he justified the measure, adding that municipalities of less than 25,000 inhabitants will receive support from the government and the financial situation of larger municipalities will be reviewed individually.  The fourth decision is to help families with children and children with a reduced home improvement loan of up to HUF 6 million with a maximum interest rate of 3 percent. Of this, HUF 3 million is a non-refundable grant, which can be used at the end of the renovation and automatically reduces the amount of the loan, the Prime Minister explained.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201219210422/https://koronavirus.gov.hu/cikkek/orban-viktor-kormany-gazdasagvedelmi-akcioterv-kiegesziteserol-rendelkezett"
