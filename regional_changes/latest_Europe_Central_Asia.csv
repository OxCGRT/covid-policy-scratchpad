Persons with COVID-19 symptoms should isolate and get tested as quickly as possible.  2. Anyone with symptoms should be kept separate from the other children, pupils, students and employees until they can be collected or sent home, and all of the probable contact points must be cleaned (e.g. the seating in the classroom, doorknobs, handles, handrails etc., that the person or child with symptoms may have touched).  A negative PCR test will mean the tested person or child is no longer suspected of having COVID-19.  If it is ascertained there is infection among the pupils or teachers, the next steps will be clarified in collaboration with the municipality and the National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) in accordance with the applicable rules for the area.    Basic principles for handling cases in relation to primary schools and day care institutions:  1.The day care institution or primary school should not allow any child or pupil who is infected or who is a close contact of an infected child or pupil from attending the institution or primary school.  2. The pupils can be tested, if required several times, rather than sending them home. The times for testing will depend on the specific case.  3. Children who do not have COVID-19 symptoms and whose parents do not want them to be tested, are recommended to remain at home for 14 days after their last near contact with the infected person.  4. Parents or other family members or people who live with the children who are near contacts, only need to pay extra attention to the infection prevention advice, including in relation to hygiene and airing out.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206122147/https://corona.nun.gl/en/at-the-workplace/guidelines-for-primary-schools-day-care-and-after-school-activities/"

Travellers who have been quarantined in Poland may perform a test â on the 8th day at the earliest, counting from the day after crossing the border â with a negative result releasing them from quarantine.

Rules concerning:    quarantine (keeping a healthy person away from others due to exposure to infection)  isolation (keeping a person or group of people suffering from SARS-CoV-2 â as confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 test â away from others to prevent further transmission)  Isolation:    If the patient has not developed symptoms of COVID-19, home isolation lasts 10 days.    Isolation ends as follows:    once 24 hours have passed without fever â without the use of antipyretic drugs and with clinical improvement â but no earlier than 10 days from the day of symptom onset â in the case of patients exhibiting clinical symptoms in:  hospital isolation or an isolation unit unless the physician responsible for the patient extends the isolation period,  home isolation unless the primary health care physician, who provided consultation via phone or at home no earlier than on the eighth day the isolation, extends the isolation period;  after 10 days from the date of obtaining the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result â in the case of patients not exhibiting clinical symptoms unless the primary health care physician, who provided consultation via phone or at home no earlier than on the eighth day the isolation, extends the isolation period.  Quarantine:    The obligation to undergo compulsory quarantine does not apply to persons vaccinated against COVID-19 as well as those who had been subjected to isolation, hospitalisation or home isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no later than 6 months from the day on which such persons, as mentioned in section 6, received a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result.

Important! As part of their regular patrols, police officers visit quarantined persons and make sure that they are staying at their place of residence. Regulations provide for a fine of up to PLN 30 thousand for breaking the quarantine. The decision concerning the actual amount of the fine is always made on a case-by-case basis.    Attention!

In Red cases, you will be admitted to hospital. If you are categorised as Green or Yellow and treatment at home is not possible, you will be hospitalised in a dedicated government facility, and discharged after 10 days if no further symptoms are observed.    If you have been in contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19, you will no longer be automatically quarantined but are required to self-isolate for 14-days and be subject to medical monitoring.""
