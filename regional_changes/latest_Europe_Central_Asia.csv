There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.    As before, day zero is the day an individual takes a PCR test, which is positive. Neither a positive at-home test nor a rapid antigen test can be used as a benchmark for day zero.    As previously stated, the amended rules came into force yesterday, regarding quarantine for those who have received a booster dose and are exposed to COVID-19. For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.  We must continue to look after vulnerable groups in society and pursue individual infection control measures as never before.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110112145/https://www.covid.is/announcements"

Self-tests people can buy in stores are not deemed reliable. A postitive result should always be confirmed with a PCR test.    Information on centres for COVID-19 PCR or rapid antigen tests  PCR-test - Symptom testing:  If you have symptoms or suspect you have an infection, you should be tested even if you have been vaccinated.  Stay at home and register immediately for testing on My Page at Heilsuvera. If you do not have an electronic ID, you can contact, by telephone, your local healthcare centre, LÃ¦knavaktin 1700 (the on-call medical hotline) or the Heilsuvera online chat. If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or LÃ¦knavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.  Symptom testing is always free of charge, for tourists as well.  Rapid antigen test - testing for asymptomatic people  Rapid antigen tests are used to screen for COVID-19 virus with asymptomatic people. If you suspect you have an infection, you should have a PCR-test.  Self-tests  Self-tests are not deemed reliable. If you test positive on a self-test, you should go for a PCR test (free) immediatly and follow the rules on isolation until your results are ready.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220116183316/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/testing-due-to-symptoms"

Your neighbor is infected (for example, in the same stairwell), unless you have been in a lot of contact.  Quarantine ends:  Quarantine can be shortened to 5 days if you go for sampling, otherwise quarantine is 14 days.  You will automatically receive a barcode for the sampling, you do not need to register specifically for it.  A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted. Households can then expect a quarantine day longer than isolation lasts. In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206184014/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi"
