Further information can be found on the website of the  Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF).""    *Universities*  Does the â3-G ruleâ - tested, recovered, vaccinated - also apply to universities and colleges?Inhalt zuklappen  In any case, it is recommended that the so-called ""3-G rule"" also authorize access to universities and colleges. As in other areas of life, those who have been tested, recovered and vaccinated should be granted access to the campus. For this, the current legal basis, the 2nd COVID-19 University Act , has been extended to the upcoming winter semester 2021/22 until February 28, 2022 and adjusted accordingly. The 3G rule is particularly relevant for participation in face-to-face courses, face-to-face exams or participation in selection, aptitude and admission procedures on site . The proven approach remains that the University and college managements are responsible for determining the specific corona measures at their locations. They know the respective conditions and requirements on site best. However, they have to guarantee the applicable level of protection, for which the current, general corona protection and hygiene measures offer a valuable basis.     Therefore, please inform yourself directly at your respective university or college how they organize their teaching and examination operations and which Corona measures they intend to take.    The 3-G rule states:     The 2nd COVID-19 Opening Ordinance defines precise criteria as to when one belongs to the group of people who have a ""low epidemiological risk"".   - Anyone who has been vaccinated with a centrally approved COVID-19 vaccine is considered vaccinated. The first vaccination counts from the 22nd day after the 1st prick for a maximum of three months from the time of vaccination. After the 2nd bite you are immunized for a total of 20 days. Vaccines for which only one vaccination is intended (e.g. from Johnson & Johnson) are valid from the 22nd day after the vaccination for a total of 270 days. This also applies to people who can be proven to have recovered as soon as they have received the first stitch.   - As tested applies to those who can provide evidence of a negative PCR test or a negative antigen test. PCR tests are valid for 72 hours from the time the sample is taken, and antigen tests for 48 hours if performed by an authorized body. Self-tests that are recorded in an official data processing system in the federal states are valid for 24 hours. In addition, there are exceptionally supervised point-of-sale tests for one-time entry of sports facilities, business premises, restaurants, hotels or an event.  - As recovered applies to those who can present a separation notice of a SARS-COV-2 infection or a medical confirmation within the last six months. Alternatively, a corresponding antibody test can be presented, which, however, must not be older than three months.  You can find more detailed information about the 3-G rule and the other applicable protective and hygiene measures on the website of the Federal Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) .

If you have a negative COVID-19 test result, your symptoms are mild, and your general condition has not been affected, you do not need to stay home.

On the same day, the government also introduced a ban on leaving oneâs home municipality (these are 212 small territorial areas with a median number of inhabitants of around 5,000; the smallest two municipalities have some 350 inhabitants) [32]. There were some exceptions, such as crossing over the boundaries of a municipality to visit family members in need of protection, assistance, support, or nursing care. Crossing between municipalities was also allowed for the purpose of visiting, e.g., grocery shops or pharmacies, if none existed in oneâs own municipality. The reason for moving between municipalities had to be proved with appropriate documents.    For the elderly population and those with physical disabilities, the introduced measure about visiting grocery stores was insufficient because they were unable to complete their shopping by 10 AM. Especially vulnerable were individuals whose social supporters all came from other municipalities. Therefore, representatives of different governmental and non-governmental organizations suggested extending the opening hours for vulnerable groups [33], as happened on April 4 [34], allowing them to also visit grocery stores in the last hour of opening.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247993"
