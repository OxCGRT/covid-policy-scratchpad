Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant.

Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing.

"64","Austria","AUT",2022-04-16,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month :  0.	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  1.	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  2.	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.

The PCR test will be used in the event of definitive confirmation or exclusion of whether the symptoms of respiratory tract infections with which the patient entered the hospital are caused by the coronavirus.  In the case of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, the doctor recommends self-isolation (sick leave) until symptoms disappear. Just like any infectious disease, such as the flu.  The length of the sick leave depends on the doctor (minimum 7 days recommended), depending on the patient's condition, risk factors for the severe course of the COVID-19 disease (e.g. lack of vaccination against COVID-19, advanced age, chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes) and high risk the occurrence of complications.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/zapisz-sie-na-test-na-koronawirusa"

Currently, children from 5 years of age can get vaccinated. There are a few basic rules to follow right before vaccination. Read on for details.    We want as many people as possible to receive the preparation against Covid-19 in the shortest possible time. It is in the interest of all of us - the vaccine offers a real chance of recovery.    E-referral    This is the document that entitles you to have the vaccine. In most cases, it is generated automatically for people who can sign up for a vaccination. Only in some cases do patients report to the doctor for this document. This happens when a given person does not have a PESEL number, or in the case of specific patients with the indicated diseases - they are informed about it.    The e-referral is valid for 90 days, but don't hesitate. If you have the opportunity, sign up for the vaccination now!    Registration for vaccination    Anyone who has an e-referral can sign up for a vaccination. There are several ways to do this:    call the helpline 989,  register online via e-Registration,  send an SMS saying SzczepimySie to the number 880 333 333,  mojeIKP - mobile application,  sign up directly at the vaccination point (preferably by phone),  use the drive-thru point .     Register for vaccination - find out the details    How to prepare for vaccinations *?    Get enough sleep before vaccination - sleep has a positive effect on the immune system.  Limit alcohol - a few days before vaccination, but also after taking the preparation, reduce the amount, and preferably do not consume alcohol at all.  Be physically active before vaccination - exercise improves your body's performance.  You do not need to fast before having the vaccine - eat all meals as normal on the day of vaccination.  Do not stop taking the medications you regularly take on your own - consult your doctor.  Carefully complete the pre-vaccination questionnaire - you will be asked to complete a medical questionnaire before taking the preparation. Don't withhold any information!  Wait after vaccination at the vaccination site of min . 15 minutes - it's for your safety.  Do not be afraid of NOP - it is short for undesirable vaccine reactions. They are mostly mild and rare. It may happen that after receiving the vaccine you will have, for example, redness at the injection site or a mild fever. These symptoms should disappear within 1-3 days. If you are more uncomfortable, you can take an anti-pyretic drug after vaccination.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/szczepimysie/jak-sie--zaszczepic"

Subsequently, state-owned banks extended deadlines for loan repayments for affected sectors, including for the national air carrier.
