The opening of schools at full capacity carries  the greatest risk of COVID-19 transmission and the emergence of hotspots, as well as widespread transmission in the  community. This risk can be reduced by implementing hygienic and epidemiological measures,    however, due to limited capacity, as well as problems in controlling the behavior of children and adolescents,  this is a challenge.    Educate staff, parents, and students about COVID-19, including symptoms, complications, how it is  transmitted, and how to prevent transmission. Get information about COVID-19 through reputable  sources such as health institutions, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF. Point out false  information / myths that can circulate orally or online.  Educate all staff and students, as well as parents as much as possible, on measures to prevent the spread of  COVID-19, as well as their importance.  Update or develop school emergency plans. These plans must include responsible  persons, activities to be taken in case any of the students, staff or their  the householder becomes ill, with suspected COVID-19; as well as a specific room or area for  isolating the patient, identification of close contacts. The plan should include contact with the  local competent health institution, to whom school staff should contact in the above case, as  well as with parents.  Regardless of how classes begin, plan teaching models for students who must be in selfisolation, as well as for parents and students who belong to vulnerable groups (chronic  diseases).  Plan mental support programs and take care of the mental health of staff and students during a  pandemic.  Basic principles of prevention  Basic principles: wearing masks for students (children aged 6 to 11 should wear a mask outside  the classroom, not necessarily during classes; while older children should wear a mask during  classes), wearing masks for teaching and other staff, maintenance adequate physical distances,  maintaining hand hygiene.  Vaccination against COVID-19 teaching staff and students depending on the recommended  age for vaccination, as well as their household members, are key strategies to help schools  function at full capacity.  Students, teachers and other staff should stay home if they or any of their household  members have COVID-19-related symptoms (main symptoms are fever, cough, loss of  sense of smell / taste, malaise; other symptoms: pain, headache, conjunctivitis, diarrhea,  skin rash).  Students, teachers and other staff should stay home if they are positive for COVID-19 or in  isolation.

Rapid antigen tests are not valid. The test must have been taken within 72 hours before departure on the first leg of the journey. A fine for not presenting a negative PCR-test is at the border is 100.000 ISK.  -Travelers must undergo testing upon arrival to Iceland.  -Quarantine and second testing: Everybody must quarantine for five days and go for another test at the end of quarantine. Please note that a new day begins at midnight. People may quarantine at home provided that their accommodation meets certain conditions. Here is a list of accommodations that accommodate guests in quarantine.  -Go directly to the quarantine location from the border entry point by airport bus, taxi, rental car or private car. Travellers are advised to stay overnight at a guesthouse near the border entry point if they are tired or the weather is bad.  -Testing and quarantine of children: Children under the age of 18 are permitted to travel to Iceland with their parents, given the parents are exempt from travel restrictions to Iceland. However, children born in or before 2004 need to undergo testing at the border, quarantine for 5 days and then be tested a second time, unless they have a certificate of full vaccination. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt from the rules at the border.  -The second testing is done at health centres around Iceland. A bar code is sent to a mobile phone the night before testing. Please note the different opening hours for testing.  -A positive result will always result in isolation, and in such cases, the instructions on home isolation must be followed. If an individual is diagnosed with a variant of the virus that is more contagious and/or causes a more serious illness, the person in question is unconditionally required to stay in a quarantine hotel. Isolation in the quarantine hotel is free of charge, and referral is in the hands of the infection tracing team and the COVID Outpatient Department at LandspÃ­tali.  -It is recommended that travellers download the Rakning C-19 app. It is used, amongst other things, to communicate negative testing results and helps to trace infections if necessary.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211122050142/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/risk-areas"

The booster dose (2nd dose) is recommended also for people who have received the first dose of Johnson&Johnson vaccine Janssen. A booster dose is not needed for persons who have received 2 doses of vaccine and who have tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with PCR test before, after or between 2 doses of the vaccines.

Regulations provide for a fine of up to PLN 30 thousand for breaking the quarantine. The decision concerning the actual amount of the fine is always made on a case-by-case basis.    Attention!

From 28 November quarantine or isolation is suspended, when you need to see a doctor. Under the above circumstances, reporting to a sanitary and epidemiological station is not required.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211124101049/https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/temporary-limitations"
