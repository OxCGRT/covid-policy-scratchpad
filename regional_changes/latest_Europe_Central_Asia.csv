Countries of the travellers origin are categorised as follows:     ""Green"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which no active circulation of the virus is observed and no variants of concern are identified. These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu. (previously, Argentina and Australia were on the Green list, but have moved to Orange)    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions. These are all countries/territories not included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries/territories. Reinforced measures are in force for travel between France and the United Kingdom. The Travel Advice sheet for the United Kingdom should be consulted.    ""Red"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus with the presence of variants of concern is observed. These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, the United States, Georgia, Mauritius, Montenegro, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey. (previously, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Zambia and Zimbabwe were on the Red list, and have now moved to Orange)    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom from 14 January:     - All travelers, vaccinated or not, must present a negative test (PCR or antigen test) taken less than 24 hours before travel  - For vaccinated travellers, there is no longer any obligation to justify a compelling reason to come to France, nor an obligation to respect a period of isolation on arrival on the national territory. As such, the need to register, prior to travel, on the digital platform ""eOS passenger"" is lifted. Screenings on arrival may be conducted at the places of arrival. In the event of a positive result, the traveller will be placed in solitary confinement.  - For unvaccinated travellers, travel to or from the United Kingdom is permitted provided that it can prove compelling reasons valid for ""red"" countries.  - Unvaccinated travellers from the United Kingdom must continue to register, before their departure, on the eOS passenger digital platform, allowing them to enter the address of their stay in France. They must, upon arrival in France, observe a strict quarantine period of 10 days at this place; this quarantine will be controlled by law enforcement.    Specific guidance for UK passengers is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202519/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/deplacements#voyager_dans_l'union_europeenne    Passengers from Green List countries are divided into two groups:     1. Member States of the European Union, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Holy See and Switzerland - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a test (PCR or antigenic) of less than 24 hours. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    2. Bahrain, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, The United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Vanuatu:  All travelers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status,from these countries/territories must present for boarding, the negative result of a PCR test or an antigen test (TAG) carried out less than 48 hours before the flight.

Rules at the border for people with vaccination or former COVID-19 infection  All travellers must pre-register before arriving in Iceland and confirm their departure day, if available.  Present a certficate of full vaccination, or a certificate of previous infection, at the border.  If a certificate is not valid the individual needs to undergo 2 tests and quarantine for 5 days in between.  NOTE. From 1 February 2022, a vaccination certificate is valid if no more than 270 days (9 months) have elapsed from the primary vaccination when an individual has not undergone a booster vaccination. Primary vaccination is considered complete after two doses of vaccine or after one Janssen injection. A booster dose cancels this expiration date.  Those who live in Iceland, or who have a network here, must go for COVID-19 testing within 48 hours of arriving in Iceland. They do not have to present a negative COVID-19 test at the border. Testing can be obtained at the border in KeflavÃ­k or at the health care centres all over Iceland. There is no need to quarantine while waiting for the results of this test, but travellers are asked to attend to personal infection control, limit contact with vulnerable individuals and be alert to the symptoms of COVID-19.  Rules for travellers without a network in Iceland: Vaccinated passengers, and those with prior infection of COVID-19, need to present a negative covid-19 test either a PCR or Rapid antigen test. NB. self-tests are not accepted. The test must have been taken within 72 hours before departure on the first leg of the journey. A fine for not presenting a negative COVID-19 test at the border is 100.000 ISK.  If a traveller has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19, they do not need to present a negative PCR or rapid antigen test at the border. Instead, a positive PCR test must be presented that is older than 7 days (isolation completed) but younger than 180 days. These individuals do not have to take a rapid antigen test or PCR test within 48 hours due to their connection with the country.  Testing and quarantine of children: Children under the age of 18 are permitted to travel to Iceland with their parents, given the parents are exempt from travel restrictions to Iceland. However, children born in or before 2004 need to undergo testing at the border, quarantine for 5 days and then be tested a second time, unless they have a certificate of full vaccination. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt from the rules at the border.  It is recommended that travellers download the Rakning C-19 app. It is used, amongst other things, to communicate negative test results and helps to trace infections if necessary.  If the slightest suspicion arises that an individual has presented a forged certificate, he/she/they will be obliged to be tested twice with quarantine in between.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220221215242/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/vaccination-and-antibodies"

Your negative test result must be from a COVID-19 viral test performed one calendar day before the day of your flight to the U.S. In other words, the testing window can be slightly more than 24 hours before your departure. If you recently recovered from COVID-19, you may instead travel with documentation of recovery from COVID-19 (i.e. your positive COVID-19 viral test result on a sample taken no more than 90 days before the flightâs departure from a foreign country, and a letter from a licensed healthcare provider or a public health official stating that you were cleared to travel).   https://archive.vn/lb1G0"
