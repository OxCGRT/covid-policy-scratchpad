Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant.

Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing.

"64","Austria","AUT",2022-04-16,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month :  0.	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  1.	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  2.	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.

Youâll find more detailed information on the Masks page.    Wearing of masks compulsory throughout Switzerland  The mask-wearing requirement applies throughout Switzerland on public transport and in hospitals, clinics, retirement and care homes. Besides the nationwide rules, the cantons can make wearing masks compulsory in additional areas and situations. For this reason you must always follow the cantonal rules.   Wearing of masks compulsory on public transport and on planes  You must wear a mask in enclosed areas of the following public transport services and facilities:  Trains, trams and buses  Mountain railways, cable cars and chair lifts  Ships and boats  Aircraft (all scheduled and chartered flights taking off or landing in Switzerland)  Note: Masks are compulsory at all times, no matter how many people are travelling. If you refuse to wear a mask on public transport, you may be asked by the transport staff to get off at the next stop. If you refuse to do so, you may receive a fine. You may remove your mask briefly to eat or drink on public transport.     Wearing of masks compulsory in publicly accessible areas  To protect particularly vulnerable people, in certain situations masks must be worn in publicly accessible indoor areas of hospital, clinics, retirement and care homes.   Wearing of masks compulsory at work  Your employer has a duty to protect you. For this reason you should find out from your employer what requirements apply in terms of mask-wearing. You will find more information on the SECO website (in German).  Exemptions from the requirement to wear a mask  Children under the age of 12 do not have to wear a mask (cantonal exemptions may apply). Masks are available in childrenâs sizes. Adult masks can also be folded and the straps shortened to fit childrenâs faces (recommended for surgical masks).  General exemptions from the requirement to wear a mask on public transport and in hospitals, clinics, retirement and care homes. In the following cases, you do not have to wear a mask (regardless of your age):  You can prove that you are unable to wear a mask for a specific reason. Such reasons include, for example, facial injuries, shortness of breath, conditions such as dementia and Alzheimerâs, anxiety when wearing a mask and disabilities that make wearing a mask intolerable or impossible. All medical grounds must be substantiated with a certificate from a doctor or psychotherapist. You will find detailed information in the factsheet from the FBED and FOPH on mask dispensing for certain people with disabilities in the Documents tab.  You are a patient in a hospital or clinic: You can take off your mask when you are in your room(s).  You are resident in a retirement or care home.  Masks in everyday life  In any situation in which you want to give yourself and others additional protection you can decide for yourself whether you want to wear a mask even if doing so is not compulsory.
