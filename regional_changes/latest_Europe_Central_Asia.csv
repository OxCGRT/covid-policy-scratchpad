These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, South Korea, The United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu.    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions.

Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom:     - subject to the list of ""compelling reasons""  - must present a negative PCR or antigenic (TAG) test taken less than 24 hours before the flight on boarding ;  - must register before departure on the eOS-COVID digital platform  ;  - may be tested antigen on arrival ;  - will be subject to mandatory isolation for 10 days,supervised and controlled by the security forces.

This is in addition to a day 2 PCR test, which both UK citizens and visitors must await the results of in isolation.

For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.

If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or LÃ¦knavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.

The measures were introduced to limit and delay the spread of the Omicron variant. The Norwegian Government is keeping the strict general entry restrictions that apply to arrival in Norway.  âOmicron is now established in many countries, including Norway. The Norwegian Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health believe that it is no longer expedient to keep specific measures that target travellers from these 8 countries. This is why the special measures are being removed. We are also keeping the strict general entry restrictions that apply to arrival in Norway,â says Minister of Health and Care Services Ingvild Kjerkol.  The special measures targeted travellers arriving from South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, and Malawi, where the virus variant was discovered. The change will enter into effect on 22 December at 12 am.""    ""Measures that will be kept  The strict general entry measures that apply to arrival in Norway will be kept. They include:  a requirement of entry registration for all travellers;    a general requirement for all travellers to get tested upon arrival in Norway;    a requirement of documentation of a negative test taken before arrival for people who cannot produce a verifiable COVID-19 certificate showing that they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 during the past 6 months;    travel quarantine for people who arrive from a country that triggers a duty to quarantine and who cannot produce a verifiable COVID-19 certificate showing that they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 during the past 6 months.""  https://archive.fo/upo3s#selection-1393.1-1427.243"
