A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months.

Given the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, measures such as “Employment Roadmap“ and support for SMEs (credit support, tax and loan payment deferrals) are expected to continue in 2021. """"  """"To support banks and the economy, the authorities have, since mid-March 2020, (i) lowered risk weights (for SME from 75% to 50%, for FX loans from 200% to 100%, and for syndicated loans from 100% to 50%); (ii) expanded the list of eligible collaterals; (iii) lowered capital conservation buffer (by one percentage point); (iv) reduced the liquidity coverage ratio requirement (from 80% to 60%), and (v) lowered limits on foreign currency positions. To support the population and SMEs, the authorities have encouraged banks and other lenders to grant loan repayment deferrals to eligible borrowers, and to freeze their loan classifications at the pre-COVID-19 status. Many of these measures are expected to remain until mid-2021 given the ongoing second wave of COVID infections; the reduced risk weights for SMEs and exemptions for holding additional provisioning against deferred loans are expected to last until end-2021.""""

At the Cabinet meeting on 27 May, the working capital grant programme for companies affected by Covid-19 was also extended by one month, at the same time allocating additional funding for supporting entrepreneurs, reducing the amount of support, and changing several other conditions for receiving it.

Netherlands,NLD,19-Jun-21,C8: International travel controls,"""""Authorities in the Netherlands are designating the UK, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal as very high risk as of June 15 due to concerns over the spread of a COVID-19 virus variant strain in those countries. All travelers that arrive from very high-risk locations need to present either a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding transport or a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in the Netherlands coupled with a negative rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding. These travelers will also need to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. Vaccinated passengers are also subject to this requirement. Exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as cross-border workers, health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.    Entry is generally only permitted for residents of EEA or Schengen-associated countries, as well as those of the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Japan, Rwanda, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Officials prohibit most travel from other countries. Exemptions are in place for healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the performance of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.    Individuals arriving from designated low-risk destinations may enter the Netherlands without restrictions. As of June 15, authorities classify Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France (only the island of Corsica), Germany, Greece (the North Aegean Region and the Ionian Islands Region only) Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, San Marino, Vatican, New Zealand, Norway (except for Oslo and Agder), Portugal, Poland, Rwanda, Slovakia, Luxembourg Singapore, South Korea, Spain (the Balearic, and the Canary Islands), Thailand, Israel Curacao, Aruba Bonaire, St Maarten, Saba, and St Eustatius as low-risk destinations.

Sweden,SWE,01-Jun-21,C8: International travel controls,"There is a travel ban on non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EU. This ban is valid until August 31.

The criteria for being granted an entry to Sweden is based on people residing in one of those countries, not citizenship. Travellers to Sweden should thus bring proof of living in one of these countries.       The entry ban does not apply to citizens and their families from EU/EEA countries and Switzerland.
