Here it is the rectors' offices, course heads and other management bodies who autonomously determine what happens at their university.""""    COVID guidelines define four operating modes for universities or colleges.  The four risk levels of the Ministry of Health's corona traffic light - level 1 - low risk (green), level 2 - moderate-medium risk (yellow), level 3 - high risk (orange) and level 4 - very high risk (red).  The university or college modes: presence mode (green), dual mode (yellow), hybrid mode (orange) and distance mode (red). The operating modes do not always have to correlate with the risk levels. So there can be a moderate-medium risk and a university can still opt for hybrid or distance operation.     Some in-person courses are running where it is necessary for the course to take place. For example, an Ordinance of the Rectorate on the participation in face-to-face courses and face-to-face exams at the Art University Linz was released on the 26 April stipulating requirements for proving a negative test or a recovered status to access the university buildings (including studios and workshops) and take part in face-to-face classes.

Seasonal employees who are not eligible for mandatory re-hiring can as of June 1 and for six months from recruitment participate in the labor ministry’s job program which will cover total insurance contributions and subsidize net salary by 200 euros.  Licensed tourist guides and tour leaders will be eligible for special purpose compensation for the months of March, April, and May 2021 after applying to the labor ministry’s Ergani system.  https://archive.ph/ocPZ4",Europe_Central_Asia,2T,2T

The quarantine period may be shortened if a negative COVID-19 test result is received no earlier than seven days after entry into the country. There are a limited number of exceptions under which arrivals are not required to quarantine. In addition, business travelers who are able to document that their employer can provide suitable alternative accommodations may be exempt from the hotel quarantine.    All permitted travelers from high-risk areas must register with authorities within 72 hours before arrival. As of May 5, only Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Finnish hospital districts of Central Ostrobothnia, Lappi, North Karelia, and Ita-Savo are not considered high-risk areas. Cross-border commuters from Sweden and Finland are permitted to enter Norway without the need to isolate provided they take a COVID-19 test every seven days.""""      https://web.archive.org/web/20210515110930/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/475281/norway-authorities-to-ease-certain-covid-19-restrictions-in-oslo-from-may-6-update-42",Europe_Central_Asia,3,3
