Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.

Use alcohol-based disinfectants (minimum 70%).  Clean contact points in buildings at least three times a day, such as door handles, window handles, faucets in toilets and kitchens, cistern buttons, remote controls, power switches, door bells, elevator buttons, reception desks and more touch surfaces used by a large number of people.  Touching contaminated surfaces by employees and clients is one of the main ways the COVID-19 virus spreads.  Clean all touch surfaces at least twice a day: desktops, smartphones and other phones, laptops, keyboards, and computers according to user instructions.  Meeting rooms, trainings and other areas where a large number of people gather should be cleaned after each meeting.  Place hand sanitizers in visible places everywhere in the work environment, especially in public places where people have fewer opportunities to wash their hands regularly. Ensure that these funds are regularly updated.  For hand washing in toilets, provide warm running water and soap, as well as disposable paper towels.  Install waste bins with lids to safely dispose of used paper towels and other waste in toilets and other rooms.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220327182232/https://covid19.fmoh.gov.ba/preporuke"

Currently, children from 5 years of age can get vaccinated. There are a few basic rules to follow right before vaccination. Read on for details.    We want as many people as possible to receive the preparation against Covid-19 in the shortest possible time. It is in the interest of all of us - the vaccine offers a real chance of recovery.    E-referral    This is the document that entitles you to have the vaccine. In most cases, it is generated automatically for people who can sign up for a vaccination. Only in some cases do patients report to the doctor for this document. This happens when a given person does not have a PESEL number, or in the case of specific patients with the indicated diseases - they are informed about it.    The e-referral is valid for 90 days, but don't hesitate. If you have the opportunity, sign up for the vaccination now!    Registration for vaccination    Anyone who has an e-referral can sign up for a vaccination. There are several ways to do this:    call the helpline 989,  register online via e-Registration,  send an SMS saying SzczepimySie to the number 880 333 333,  mojeIKP - mobile application,  sign up directly at the vaccination point (preferably by phone),  use the drive-thru point .     Register for vaccination - find out the details    How to prepare for vaccinations *?    Get enough sleep before vaccination - sleep has a positive effect on the immune system.  Limit alcohol - a few days before vaccination, but also after taking the preparation, reduce the amount, and preferably do not consume alcohol at all.  Be physically active before vaccination - exercise improves your body's performance.  You do not need to fast before having the vaccine - eat all meals as normal on the day of vaccination.  Do not stop taking the medications you regularly take on your own - consult your doctor.  Carefully complete the pre-vaccination questionnaire - you will be asked to complete a medical questionnaire before taking the preparation. Don't withhold any information!  Wait after vaccination at the vaccination site of min . 15 minutes - it's for your safety.  Do not be afraid of NOP - it is short for undesirable vaccine reactions. They are mostly mild and rare. It may happen that after receiving the vaccine you will have, for example, redness at the injection site or a mild fever. These symptoms should disappear within 1-3 days. If you are more uncomfortable, you can take an anti-pyretic drug after vaccination.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/szczepimysie/jak-sie--zaszczepic"
