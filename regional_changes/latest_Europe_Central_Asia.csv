For more information, visit their website.  Public Health Labs:  Currently, to be tested for COVID-19 by the Albanian public health authority one must have symptoms and a recommendation from the public health authorityâs family doctor.  However, private testing labs will perform a test for a fee, and no symptoms or a doctorâs recommendation is required (see details below).  If you have an Albanian social security number, you also have an assigned public health family doctor.  To learn who your public health family doctor is, call the help line at 0-800-4040 to find out.  Tests are free of charge if done by the Albanian Institute of Public Health (IPH).  Private Labs:  Individuals can also arrange private testing by going to a private testing lab. No symptoms or doctorâs order is required to arrange a private test, and no advance appointment is necessary.  According to the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are several private labs authorized to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing for administrative issues. For a full list, please see the Ministry of Health list here.  Hard copy letters of test results are provided within 24 to 72 hrs. You can arrange another method of delivery (e.g.: email or text) with the individual labs.  Stay home and contact the Albanian National Medical Emergency line at 127 if you believe that you have contracted the COVID-19 virus.  Wait for guidance before going to a medical facility.  More information can be obtained by calling the national green line at 0-800-4040 to find out.

Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

You may remove your mask briefly to eat or drink on public transport.     Wearing of masks compulsory in publicly accessible areas  To protect particularly vulnerable people, in certain situations masks must be worn in publicly accessible indoor areas of hospital, clinics, retirement and care homes.
