Use of the Health Pass will not be required in schools. A four-tier system of restrictions will be in place with controls depending on the incidence of COVID-19. In summary:     Level 1 (Green): In person learning at all levels,   Level 2 (Yellow): In person learning at all levels,  Level 3 (Orange): In person learning at primary and middle schools, hybrid learning (alternating distance and in-person learning) in high schools  Level 4 (Red): In person learning in primary schools, hybrid learning for 50% of 3rd year, all 4th year and high school students.    Increasing levels of sanitary requirements, mask-wearing, restrictions on sports, and protocols for contact tracing will be applied at each level. The decision to trigger movement between levels can be taken at either national or department level.     Between 6000 and 7000 vaccination centers will be deployed in or next to schools alongside a campaign to encourage vaccination for children aged 12 and over.

If the percentage of teachers vaccinated is too low, we will have to move towards that"" - https://web.archive.org/web/20210729145019/https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2021/07/28/dans-les-colleges-et-lycees-les-eleves-non-vaccines-seront-evinces-s-il-y-a-un-cas-de-covid-19-dans-une-classe_6089766_3224.html"

In addition, starting Aug. 8, all travelers aged 12 or older who have not been fully vaccinated or have not recovered from the disease in the last six months will need to show a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival or a negative result from an antigen test no older than 24 hours before returning to the Netherlands from an EU country designated at the yellow (medium) level of risk. Furthermore, from Aug. 8, all travelers arriving from designated green (low) risk destinations outside of the EU will need to either present a certificate of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result upon arrival.    Authorities generally permit entry for residents of EEA or Schengen-associated countries, as well as those of the Dutch Caribbean Territories and several other countries outside of the Schengen Zone, including the US, Australia, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea. Individuals arriving from designated low-risk destinations must fill out a health declaration form before entering. There are currently no other entry restrictions for travelers from these locations. For a full list of low-risk countries and territories, please click here.    Officials prohibit most travel from other countries.

A ban on entry to Sweden is in effect for non-essential travel from most countries outside the EU/EEA.     If you are a Swedish citizen  - The Public Health Agency of Sweden recommends that those who have traveled outside the Nordic region take a PCR test when returning to Sweden. This applies even if you do not have any symptoms.   - When returning from countries for which UD has issued a travel advisory, the Public Health Agency's recommendation regarding testing and isolation applies for one week after arrival in Sweden.  - Fully vaccinated individuals without symptoms are exempt from the recommendation of testing and isolation after arrival in Sweden regardless of which country they have been in.    Note: These rules also apply to foreign nationals who are registered residents in Sweden or who live in Sweden with a valid residence permit, right of residence or residence status.    If you are a foreign national from the EU/EEA  - In order to travel into Sweden, foreign nationals travelling from an EU/EEA country need to have a Covid certificate, a negative Covid-19 test no more than 72 hours old or proof of a return to health. The Covid certificate shows that a person has been tested negative, has been vaccinated against, or recovered from Covid-19. This will apply until 31 August 2021.   - Inbound journeys are allowed no later than 72 hours after a negative test result or 14 days after a first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine. A certificate showing a return to health from SARS-CoV-2 infection allows an inbound journey at the earliest 11 days after a positive test. The certificate can be digital or on paper. It has to be issued in the issuing country's official language and English. A separate certificate should be issued for every - -- vaccination, test result, or proof of a return to health. The certificate must include details about the person's identity, which vaccine they've been given, and how many shots they have had.  - Exceptions are made for foreign nationals who are registered residents in Sweden or who live in Sweden with a valid residence permit, right of residence or residence status. For these, the same rules apply as for Swedish citizens.  - The requirement for a negative Covid-19 test, recoviery or vaccination does not apply if you travel from Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway.  - The requirements apply to everyone who is 18 years or older, and not to children.  - The Public Health Agency of Sweden recommends that those who have traveled outside the Nordic region take a PCR test when returning to Sweden. This applies even if you do not have any symptoms.   - When you arrive from countries covered by travel advisories from the Swedish Ministry of foreign affairs (""UD""), the Public Health Agency's recommendation regarding testing and isolation applies for one week after arrival in Sweden.      If you are a foreign national from a country outside the EU/EEA  - There is a ban on non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EU/EEA. The ban applies to foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA and will remain in effect until 31 August 2021. Certain individuals who have particularly urgent needs or who are going to carry out essential services in Sweden may be exempt.  - Foreign nationals who fulfil the requirements for an exemption are advised to get tested for Covid-19 when they arrive in Sweden and five days after their arrival. They should also self-isolate for one week after arriving in Sweden.     - A number of countries are exempt from the entry ban. The decisive factor is whether you live in one of the countries, not if you are a citizen. Travellers to Sweden should therefore be prepared to provide documentation showing that they live in one of the aforementioned countries in order to be granted entry.  - Exempted travellers need to show results from a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old before entry.  Currently exempt countries and terrirories: Australia, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Israel, Japan. In addition, from 30 June 2021, those living in one of the following countries will also be allowed to enter Sweden: Albania, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macao, North Macedonia, Serbia, Taiwan, and the USA.    - Foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA can enter Sweden from EU/EEA countries if they can present a certificate proving a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old. This requirement does not apply if you travel from Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210816060955/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/travel-restrictions"
