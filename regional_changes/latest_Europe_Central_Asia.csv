Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

The National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) recommends the following for persons who are at a higher risk:  -Get re-vaccinated  -Follow the recommendations from the Office of the Medical Director of Health and ask others to be mindful  -Avoid large events and gatherings of people where you canât keep a distance to other people  -Consider using a face mask in public spaces where you canât keep a distance to other people  -Consider talking with your workplace about how to ensure that you can go to work safely    The older you are â the more and more serious chronic diseases have â the more attention you need to pay to following the recommendations.

"670","Poland","POL",2022-04-02,"Europe_Central_Asia","H7: Vaccination policy","5G","5G","No change  How to get vaccinated?  The pass for vaccination is e-referral. Currently, children from 5 years of age can get vaccinated. There are a few basic rules to follow right before vaccination. Read on for details.    We want as many people as possible to receive the preparation against Covid-19 in the shortest possible time. It is in the interest of all of us - the vaccine offers a real chance of recovery.    E-referral    This is the document that entitles you to have the vaccine. In most cases, it is generated automatically for people who can sign up for a vaccination. Only in some cases do patients report to the doctor for this document. This happens when a given person does not have a PESEL number, or in the case of specific patients with the indicated diseases - they are informed about it.    The e-referral is valid for 90 days, but don't hesitate. If you have the opportunity, sign up for the vaccination now!    Registration for vaccination    Anyone who has an e-referral can sign up for a vaccination. There are several ways to do this:    call the helpline 989,  register online via e-Registration,  send an SMS saying SzczepimySie to the number 880 333 333,  mojeIKP - mobile application,  sign up directly at the vaccination point (preferably by phone),  use the drive-thru point .     Register for vaccination - find out the details    How to prepare for vaccinations *?    Get enough sleep before vaccination - sleep has a positive effect on the immune system.  Limit alcohol - a few days before vaccination, but also after taking the preparation, reduce the amount, and preferably do not consume alcohol at all.  Be physically active before vaccination - exercise improves your body's performance.  You do not need to fast before having the vaccine - eat all meals as normal on the day of vaccination.  Do not stop taking the medications you regularly take on your own - consult your doctor.  Carefully complete the pre-vaccination questionnaire - you will be asked to complete a medical questionnaire before taking the preparation. Don't withhold any information!  Wait after vaccination at the vaccination site of min . 15 minutes - it's for your safety.  Do not be afraid of NOP - it is short for undesirable vaccine reactions. They are mostly mild and rare. It may happen that after receiving the vaccine you will have, for example, redness at the injection site or a mild fever. These symptoms should disappear within 1-3 days. If you are more uncomfortable, you can take an anti-pyretic drug after vaccination.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/szczepimysie/jak-sie--zaszczepic"

Subsequently, state-owned banks extended deadlines for loan repayments for affected sectors, including for the national air carrier. The central bank reduced its policy rate by 200 basis points in 2020. The policy rate was reduced from 16 to 15 percent on April 15, and from 15 to 14 percent on September 8. While the central bank has not changed requirements for regulatory capital or liquidity, it delayed phasing in tighter liquidity regulations and restricted banksâ dividend distributions. In October 2020, the authorities recommended that banks consider further deferral of loan repayments on a case by case basis.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220417173221/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
