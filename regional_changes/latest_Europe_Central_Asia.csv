Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom from 14 January:     - All travelers, vaccinated or not, must present a negative test (PCR or antigen test) taken less than 24 hours before travel  - For vaccinated travellers, there is no longer any obligation to justify a compelling reason to come to France, nor an obligation to respect a period of isolation on arrival on the national territory. As such, the need to register, prior to travel, on the digital platform ""eOS passenger"" is lifted. Screenings on arrival may be conducted at the places of arrival. In the event of a positive result, the traveller will be placed in solitary confinement.  - For unvaccinated travellers, travel to or from the United Kingdom is permitted provided that it can prove compelling reasons valid for ""red"" countries.  - Unvaccinated travellers from the United Kingdom must continue to register, before their departure, on the eOS passenger digital platform, allowing them to enter the address of their stay in France. They must, upon arrival in France, observe a strict quarantine period of 10 days at this place; this quarantine will be controlled by law enforcement.    Specific guidance for UK passengers is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202519/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/deplacements#voyager_dans_l'union_europeenne    Passengers from Green List countries are divided into two groups:     1. Member States of the European Union, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Holy See and Switzerland - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a test (PCR or antigenic) of less than 24 hours. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    2. Bahrain, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, The United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Vanuatu:  All travelers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status,from these countries/territories must present for boarding, the negative result of a PCR test or an antigen test (TAG) carried out less than 48 hours before the flight. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220128204055/https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/informations-pratiques/article/coronavirus-covid-19"

There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.    As before, day zero is the day an individual takes a PCR test, which is positive. Neither a positive at-home test nor a rapid antigen test can be used as a benchmark for day zero.    As previously stated, the amended rules came into force yesterday, regarding quarantine for those who have received a booster dose and are exposed to COVID-19. For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.  We must continue to look after vulnerable groups in society and pursue individual infection control measures as never before.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110112145/https://www.covid.is/announcements"

Stay at home and register immediately for testing on My Page at Heilsuvera. If you do not have an electronic ID, you can contact, by telephone, your local healthcare centre, LÃ¦knavaktin 1700 (the on-call medical hotline) or the Heilsuvera online chat. If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or LÃ¦knavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.  Symptom testing is always free of charge, for tourists as well.  Rapid antigen test - testing for asymptomatic people  Rapid antigen tests are used to screen for COVID-19 virus with asymptomatic people. If you suspect you have an infection, you should have a PCR-test.  Self-tests  Self-tests are not deemed reliable.

Quarantine ends:  Quarantine can be shortened to 5 days if you go for sampling, otherwise quarantine is 14 days.  You will automatically receive a barcode for the sampling, you do not need to register specifically for it.  A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted. Households can then expect a quarantine day longer than isolation lasts. In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206184014/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi"
