"61","Austria","AUT",2022-04-16,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month :  0.	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  1.	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  2.	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.    For all additional tests, you can use the chargeable test offer in Austria.  At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.  The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.

This is what the Infection Protection Act provides. Distance rules and mask requirements at schools no longer apply. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Hamburg were initially an exception because they made use of the hotspot regulation. In the meantime, however, the mask requirement has also been completely omitted here. The corona test obligation also no longer exists in most federal states. In this news blog, the school portal informs about what the relaxation in the federal states looks like in concrete terms and how the abolition of the mask requirement and other measures affects the infection situation in schools."
