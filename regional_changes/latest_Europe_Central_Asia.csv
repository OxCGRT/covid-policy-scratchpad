Belarus,BLR,03-Apr-21,H2: Testing policy,"This may be one reason Belarus also outperformed most of Europe in terms of mass testing during the first four months of the pandemic. While many countries were reluctant to carry out extensive testing, according to the state owned news agency BelTA, testing in Belarus started as early as 23 January. Most kits were donated or purchased from China and Russia2 using government funds and donations from companies3 and ordinary citizens.4 The country stepped up testing in early April,5 developing its own rapid testing kits6 and switching to the use of domestically produced reagents for polymerase chain reaction testing in May.7 According to government information, there are now 32 laboratories processing samples across the country and testing is widespread in hospitals as well as from GPs.  http://web.archive.org/web/20210413102919/https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3543",Europe_Central_Asia,3,3

However, Authorities in Denmark plan to start gradually easing COVID-19-related international travel and domestic activity restrictions. Starting April 21, the Danish government will begin using a color-coded system for classifying foreign countries as being at one of three risk levels - red, orange, or yellow - based on local infection rates and the presence of variant strains, and will apply international travel restrictions accordingly. Travelers arriving from """"yellow"""" countries or regions will not need to self-isolate upon entry. Those arriving from ''orange'' and """"red"""" areas will need to self-isolate for 10 days upon entry. In addition, business travelers will no longer be required to quarantine. All travelers must still, upon arrival, present a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to travel.  Starting May 1, fully vaccinated citizens and residents of Denmark, as well as tourists from yellow and orange countries, will be able to travel to Denmark without restrictions. In addition, the requirement for a negative Covid-19 test result will change; effective May 1, the test will need to have been taken no more than 48 hours before travel, rather than the current threshold of 24 hours.  Most travel from outside the EEA, with the exception of that from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, will be prohibited.

Mass vaccination is expected to start after priority groups complete vaccination, likely in May.

Sweden,SWE,20-Apr-21,C8: International travel controls,"There is a ban on unnecessary travel to Sweden from countries outside the EU. The ban applies until 31 May 2021.  The entry ban does not apply to Swedish citizens or citizens of another EU / EEA country. Citizens of another EU / EEA country must present a maximum of 48 hours old negative covid-19 test. There are exceptions to the test requirement . Swedish citizens are recommended to test themselves after a stay abroad.  Swedish border inspectors decide how the exceptions are to be interpreted and what decisions are to be made. It is the traveler's own responsibility to be able to prove his right to an exception in border control. It is therefore necessary to be able to present, for example, employment certificates or extracts from the population register.     In addition, the following recommendation applies to everyone, including Swedes:   The Public Health Agency recommends everyone who travels into Sweden , regardless of citizenship, to test themselves upon entry and to avoid contacts for seven days. Five days after arriving from abroad, the traveler should take a second test. This applies regardless of whether you are covered by the requirement to present a negative covid-19 test before entry. Stay home for at least seven days. Avoid contact with others as much as possible. Test yourself as soon as possible after arrival in Sweden with a follow-up test after five days.    http://web.archive.org/web/20210423192607/https://www.krisinformation.se/detta-kan-handa/handelser-och-storningar/20192/myndigheterna-om-det-nya-coronaviruset/reseinformation-med-anledning-av-det-nya-coronaviruset",Europe_Central_Asia,3,3
