A fact that will reinforce the control and management of the epidemiological situation and that at the same time will favour the move from a strategy of total confinement to one of selective confinement of the people infected by the coronavirus and his contacts. In this way, the protection of the most vulnerable citizens is enhanced and at the same time minimizes the probability of contagion in the work and school environment. The tests, consisting of a practically painless finger prick, will be performed free of charge to everyone.  There will be two tests to all citizens in two waves, separated by fifteen days, being the final result of the test the sum of the two tests. That is, two tests that offer a single result. In this sense, people who test positive in the first analysis of antibodies will be warned and isolated in order to take a PCR test and check if they have the disease at that time. The rest of the citizens, after the first test, will receive instructions on what to do and will obtain a final result when both tests have been done.  https://archive.vn/O1yU0"

Short-time work supports companies in order to keep as many employees as possible in the company, even in times of financial crisis. The employment service (AMS) takes over the majority of the salary payments.     Short-time working cannot be requested by individual employees; this decision can only be made by the company itself. In general, support can only be given to companies that have been severely affected by the current corona crisis and have thus got into a critical financial situation.    80-90% of the salary will be covered during short-time work.    The Corona short-time work is currently limited to a duration of 3 months. This time frame can later be extended by a further 3 months.    In principle, all employees subject to unemployment insurance are eligible for short-time work, provided they have a fully paid calendar month before starting short-time work.    Members of the executive body are eligible if they are ASVG-insured; also board members who are subject to the ASVG.    Apprentices are eligible.

The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

"168","Belgium","BEL",2020-12-28,"Europe_Central_Asia","H7: Vaccination policy","1G","0","On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac.      Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start?  No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?"")  At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial.    To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available.    GROUP 1a    First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated.    Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions.  The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin.  In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.).    GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk    In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups:    People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down.  People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as:  Diabetes,  Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis,  All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments)  Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30).  This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments,    Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups.  GROUP 2 - general population    Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population.    At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine).    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115165454/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/vaccination/    Note: Belgium was criticised for being slow off the mark with vaccinations:  About 700 residents and staff of care homes have gotten their first shot as of January 2, when the government provided its latest update on the tally. In Germany, by contrast, roughly 317,000 doses have been administered, and about 182,000 in Italy. Yves Van Laethem, an infectious diseases specialist and spokesman for Belgium's COVID-19 crisis center, said the country is also getting fewer doses than initially promised by Pfizer — only 320,000 instead of 600,000 by late December — forcing the government to make a choice between healthcare workers and the elderly. They said they would prioritise the elderly. Hence only one group have been vaccinated in this early stage.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210107121941/https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-government-criticism-coronavirus-vaccine-campaign-frank-vandenbroucke/    Other notes:  Belgium received its first batch of 9,750 vaccines last Saturday (Dec 26, 2020) and began vaccinating  between 300 and 400 people today.     Residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals will be the first to be vaccinated. Vaccinations started in three care homes across Belgium (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in Brussels, Mons in Wallonia and Puurs in Flanders, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was produced).    Under the second phase of the plan, people over 65, patients between 45 and 65 years old at high risk from the virus due to obesity or lung disease, and people with essential jobs will get their shot. Finally, other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated.    The timing of the different phases will depend on how many doses are available at different times, and how difficult it is to store the vaccines.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165332/https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/28/covid-vaccine-man-96-is-first-to-receive-coronavirus-jab-in-belgium  https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165542/https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-belgiums-vaccination-strategy/"

Professor Corinne Vandermeulen, a professor at the KU Leuven Vaccinology Department says, ""we're doing the best we can. And of course there can be critics and I know that people criticize the fact that we choose to vaccinate the people in the long term care facilities first and that we might have started with healthcare workers maybe first instead of the elderly.

The intensified testing scheme comprises all citizens.  Announcements will be made locally as to where and when the new testing  opportunities will be available. People are urged to await such  announcements before booking tests unless the test is booked for other  specific reasons such as mild symptoms and test slots for close contacts.  Further, particular efforts will be targeted at young citizens in Greater  Copenhagen who typically account for the highest infection rates.

This applies to healthcare workers and others working in emergency departments and intensive care units in hospitals, on COVID-19 wards and wards for patients who have been infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers who perform screening tests in cases of suspected COVID-19 and the staff of nursing and retirement homes. The vaccination of persons living in nursing and retirement homes and old-age wards in hospitals will also have high priority.    There are ten priority groups. The groups with the greatest priority consist of a relatively few number of people; the first five groups are estimated to number around 20,000 persons.    Group 6: Persons aged 60 and older    Group 7: Persons with underlying long-term illnesses    Group 8: Employees of nursery, primary and secondary schools and select groups of social and welfare service workers    Group 9: Persons who are in sensitive circumstances due to their social and economic situation    And finally, Group 10: All others who request vaccination, as determined by the Chief Epidemiologist.    The regulation makes no provision for the COVID-19 vaccination of children born 2006 or later unless such children have an underlying long-term illness and are members of a special risk group.
