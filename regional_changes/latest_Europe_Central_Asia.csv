In this way, the protection of the most vulnerable citizens is enhanced and at the same time minimizes the probability of contagion in the work and school environment. The tests, consisting of a practically painless finger prick, will be performed free of charge to everyone.

In this sense, people who test positive in the first analysis of antibodies will be warned and isolated in order to take a PCR test and check if they have the disease at that time.

While the policy text seems to allow some exceptions to the work from home, other analyses of this policy refer to it as a mandatory work from home requirement for non-essential workers.    ON CODING:   For now, this policy is coded as a 2G rather than 3G since employees in certain sectors still are able to go to work or choose not to work from home even when given the option. Furthermore, the consideration of ski resorts, hair salons, etc. as 'essential' fails to meet the threshold for 3G, which requires closure of ""all-but-essential workplaces"" like grocery stores.

The latest announcement of Denmark’s authorities clarified that the whole world would be “sharpened from being orange to red.”    Denmark’s Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has stressed that the new mutations of the Coronavirus pandemic, spread in several other countries pose a significant risk that Denmark’s infection rates may escalate.      “The safety and security of Danes is the government’s priority. We can see the finish line. The vaccine is here. We must not stumble on the run-up stretch. Not least in the light of the new mutations, we will have to – all of us – make an extra effort. And today’s package of travel initiatives is an expression of that,” says Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod.    Recently Denmark announced plans to impose a digital ‘vaccine passport’ which would permit all vaccinated citizens against COVID-19 disease to travel to countries which oblige citizens to have such a document, in order to be able to enter these countries.    According to the Danish Health Ministry, the ‘vaccine passport will be rolled out in early 2021,” and all those vaccinated would be eligible to obtain the document through Denmark’s public health website.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210111123210/https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/denmark-temporarily-bans-from-entering-citizens-of-all-countries/    From 5:00 p.m. on 9 January 2021 through 7 February 2021, Denmark has instituted a flight ban on the transport of passengers, including Danish citizens, who are unable to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours before departure.   https://archive.vn/eOv2R"

The City Government is regularly extending the groups of residents who can sign up for vaccination. Currently, these groups include:    Muscovites over 60 (they are at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 and complications);  People with chronic conditions who are required to stay at home during the pandemic;  College and university students aged 18 and older.    Also, people aged 18 and over who work in the following fields and organisations can get vaccinated. In the future, it will be available to all Moscow residents.    As this is not yet available across all of Russia, I have coded this as a 1 for group C elderly groups, until more evidence emerges that this is accessible country wide    http://web.archive.org/web/20210108222859/https://www.mos.ru/en/city/projects/covid-19/"

This is already a third vaccine developed by our scientists. It will go into civilian circulation in the next few months.
