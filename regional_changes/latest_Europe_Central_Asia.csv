Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

E-referral    This is the document that entitles you to have the vaccine. In most cases, it is generated automatically for people who can sign up for a vaccination. Only in some cases do patients report to the doctor for this document. This happens when a given person does not have a PESEL number, or in the case of specific patients with the indicated diseases - they are informed about it.    The e-referral is valid for 90 days, but don't hesitate. If you have the opportunity, sign up for the vaccination now!    Registration for vaccination    Anyone who has an e-referral can sign up for a vaccination. There are several ways to do this:    call the helpline 989,  register online via e-Registration,  send an SMS saying SzczepimySie to the number 880 333 333,  mojeIKP - mobile application,  sign up directly at the vaccination point (preferably by phone),  use the drive-thru point .

Be physically active before vaccination - exercise improves your body's performance.  You do not need to fast before having the vaccine - eat all meals as normal on the day of vaccination.  Do not stop taking the medications you regularly take on your own - consult your doctor.

It may happen that after receiving the vaccine you will have, for example, redness at the injection site or a mild fever. These symptoms should disappear within 1-3 days. If you are more uncomfortable, you can take an anti-pyretic drug after vaccination.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/szczepimysie/jak-sie--zaszczepic"
