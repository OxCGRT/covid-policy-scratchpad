"61","Austria","AUT",2022-04-16,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month :  0.	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  1.	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  2.	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.    For all additional tests, you can use the chargeable test offer in Austria.  At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.  The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.

Use alcohol-based disinfectants (minimum 70%).  Clean contact points in buildings at least three times a day, such as door handles, window handles, faucets in toilets and kitchens, cistern buttons, remote controls, power switches, door bells, elevator buttons, reception desks and more touch surfaces used by a large number of people.  Touching contaminated surfaces by employees and clients is one of the main ways the COVID-19 virus spreads.  Clean all touch surfaces at least twice a day: desktops, smartphones and other phones, laptops, keyboards, and computers according to user instructions.  Meeting rooms, trainings and other areas where a large number of people gather should be cleaned after each meeting.  Place hand sanitizers in visible places everywhere in the work environment, especially in public places where people have fewer opportunities to wash their hands regularly. Ensure that these funds are regularly updated.  For hand washing in toilets, provide warm running water and soap, as well as disposable paper towels.  Install waste bins with lids to safely dispose of used paper towels and other waste in toilets and other rooms.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220327182232/https://covid19.fmoh.gov.ba/preporuke"

The test result is known after a few or several minutes. Your doctor will order this test for someone with symptoms that may be caused by a coronavirus infection. The test will be free for the patient. In the current situation, with a significant decrease in the incidence of COVID-19, there is no need to massively test patients for coronavirus before visiting a primary health care clinic, a specialist doctor's office or in a hospital before the planned surgery.    A PCR test may be ordered by your doctor prior to admission to hospital if deemed necessary. In practice, the PCR test will be used in the event of definitive confirmation or exclusion of whether the symptoms of respiratory tract infections with which the patient entered the hospital are caused by the coronavirus.  https://web.archive.org/https://www.nfz.gov.pl/aktualnosci/aktualnosci-centrali/nowe-zasady-testowania-w-kierunku-koronawirusa-co-musisz-wiedziec,8182.html"

Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220411094017/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/coronavirus    Which vaccines are available in TAJIKISTAN?    The U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe is aware that Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines are available at Prospekt Medical Clinic (48-702-44-00), subject to availability.  Please contact the clinic directly for information about cost and availability.  The quality of Tajikistanâs medical infrastructure is significantly below Western standards, with shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics.  Due to extremely limited vaccine availability, we strongly recommend that travelers complete their COVID-19 vaccination before traveling to Tajikistan.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220409143707/https://tj.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
