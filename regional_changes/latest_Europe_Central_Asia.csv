In this way, the protection of the most vulnerable citizens is enhanced and at the same time minimizes the probability of contagion in the work and school environment. The tests, consisting of a practically painless finger prick, will be performed free of charge to everyone.  There will be two tests to all citizens in two waves, separated by fifteen days, being the final result of the test the sum of the two tests. That is, two tests that offer a single result. In this sense, people who test positive in the first analysis of antibodies will be warned and isolated in order to take a PCR test and check if they have the disease at that time.

"183","Belgium","BEL",2020-12-28,"Europe_Central_Asia","H7: Vaccination policy","1G","0","C:    On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac.      Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start?  No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?"")  At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial.    To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available.    GROUP 1a    First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated.    Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions.  The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin.  In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.).    GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk    In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups:    People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down.  People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as:  Diabetes,  Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis,  All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments)  Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30).  This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments,    Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups.  GROUP 2 - general population    Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population.    At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine).    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115165454/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/vaccination/    Note: Belgium was criticised for being slow off the mark with vaccinations:  About 700 residents and staff of care homes have gotten their first shot as of January 2, when the government provided its latest update on the tally. In Germany, by contrast, roughly 317,000 doses have been administered, and about 182,000 in Italy. Yves Van Laethem, an infectious diseases specialist and spokesman for Belgium's COVID-19 crisis center, said the country is also getting fewer doses than initially promised by Pfizer — only 320,000 instead of 600,000 by late December — forcing the government to make a choice between healthcare workers and the elderly. They said they would prioritise the elderly. Hence only one group have been vaccinated in this early stage.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210107121941/https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-government-criticism-coronavirus-vaccine-campaign-frank-vandenbroucke/    Other notes:  Belgium received its first batch of 9,750 vaccines last Saturday (Dec 26, 2020) and began vaccinating  between 300 and 400 people today.     Residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals will be the first to be vaccinated. Vaccinations started in three care homes across Belgium (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in Brussels, Mons in Wallonia and Puurs in Flanders, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was produced).    Under the second phase of the plan, people over 65, patients between 45 and 65 years old at high risk from the virus due to obesity or lung disease, and people with essential jobs will get their shot. Finally, other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated.    The timing of the different phases will depend on how many doses are available at different times, and how difficult it is to store the vaccines.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165332/https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/28/covid-vaccine-man-96-is-first-to-receive-coronavirus-jab-in-belgium  https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165542/https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-belgiums-vaccination-strategy/"

Professor Corinne Vandermeulen, a professor at the KU Leuven Vaccinology Department says, ""we're doing the best we can. And of course there can be critics and I know that people criticize the fact that we choose to vaccinate the people in the long term care facilities first and that we might have started with healthcare workers maybe first instead of the elderly.

In addition, Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged all its citizens to avoid travelling to other countries due to the disease’s rapid spread, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.    The latest announcement of Denmark’s authorities clarified that the whole world would be “sharpened from being orange to red.”    Denmark’s Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has stressed that the new mutations of the Coronavirus pandemic, spread in several other countries pose a significant risk that Denmark’s infection rates may escalate.      “The safety and security of Danes is the government’s priority. We can see the finish line. The vaccine is here. We must not stumble on the run-up stretch. Not least in the light of the new mutations, we will have to – all of us – make an extra effort. And today’s package of travel initiatives is an expression of that,” says Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod.    Recently Denmark announced plans to impose a digital ‘vaccine passport’ which would permit all vaccinated citizens against COVID-19 disease to travel to countries which oblige citizens to have such a document, in order to be able to enter these countries.    According to the Danish Health Ministry, the ‘vaccine passport will be rolled out in early 2021,” and all those vaccinated would be eligible to obtain the document through Denmark’s public health website.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210111123210/https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/denmark-temporarily-bans-from-entering-citizens-of-all-countries/    From 5:00 p.m. on 9 January 2021 through 7 February 2021, Denmark has instituted a flight ban on the transport of passengers, including Danish citizens, who are unable to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours before departure.   https://archive.vn/eOv2R"

Regional government agencies' regulations on restrictions on gatherings do not apply to private events, such as weddings organized by private individuals. Private events are all private events that are not open to the public, such as weddings, funerals, christenings, birthday parties, and private evenings. However, the government recommends that general guidelines on hygiene, safety distances, and other arrangements to prevent coronavirus infections be followed at these events as well.    Public events are allowed in as much as the meeting regulations allow, so those areas whereby 10 people maximum can meet (see C4) are consequentially unable to hold events. Hence 2T. In Helinki, correspondingly, all indoor and outdoor public events and general meetings are prohibited for a limited period of time, allowing up to 10 people to attend essential public events and meetings, provided that safety can be ensured in accordance with the instructions issued by the Ministry of Education and Culture and THL on 21.9.2020.?

The City Government is regularly extending the groups of residents who can sign up for vaccination. Currently, these groups include:    Muscovites over 60 (they are at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 and complications);  People with chronic conditions who are required to stay at home during the pandemic;  College and university students aged 18 and older.    Also, people aged 18 and over who work in the following fields and organisations can get vaccinated. In the future, it will be available to all Moscow residents.

When entering the Republic of Slovenia, negative PCR tests are required in case of arrival from third countries, which must not be older than 48 hours. Rapid antigen tests are valid only if done in the EU or the Schengen Area.     Testing with rapid antigen tests at border crossings has been abolished on the external Schengen border. The five border crossings and the Jože Pucnik Airport that have been offering rapid tests will therefore no longer continue to do so.    Anyone who does not present this proof will have to go into quarantine, which can, however, be lifted if the person takes a test within five days of the decision being issued.     Finland is removed from the red list, which means that entry from this country is possible without quarantine or a negative test.
