Do you have to wear a mask if you can keep enough distance to other people?  According to the recommendation, you must wear a mask if you are unable to keep enough distance from other people, which means that you can use discretion based on the situation.    There are situations where customers and staff have been protected by other safety arrangements, such as protective shields.    Regional authorities provide instructions about wearing masks based on the situation in the local area (municipality or hospital district).    What is meant by public transport?  Public transport includes modes of public transport such as buses, trams, metros, ships, and airplanes.    When should you put on a mask?  Put on a mask before entering public transport or a public indoor space in accordance with regional guidelines.""  http://web.archive.org/web/20201010155109/https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/transmission-and-protection-coronavirus/recommendation-on-the-use-of-face-masks-for-citizens/questions-and-answers-about-face-masks"

Listen   The Public Health Agency does not currently consider it necessary to close all schools in Sweden. There are no scientific evidence indicating that such an intervention would have any significant impact on the pandemic, nor has any major transmission of COVID-19 in schools been reported.    Closing schools and pre-schools would have a negative impact on society. For example, essential workers to the public (e.g. healthcare staff) would need to stay at home with their children. It could also put vulnerable groups, such as grandparents, at risk if they help out with childcare.    School is also a place of safety and stability for many children. Before closing a school, there must be plans made for alternative places where the children should go instead. However, it is of utmost importance that staff and children who have any symptoms of illness stay at home.    The Swedish Parliament has passed a bill (2020:148) allowing temporary closure of schools and pre-schools due to extraordinary events, making it possible for the Government or the head of a school to close schools under particular circumstances. There is also a regulation (2020:115) regarding the provision of education for pupils during a school closure."
