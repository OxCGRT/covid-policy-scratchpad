Children may not attend school if one of the self-tests is positive.     Additional measures were announced by the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports on 13 January, including:     - the distribution of 5 million FFP2 masks in establishments for staff who feel the need;  - the replenishment of the fund for the purchase of CO2 sensors as much as necessary, so that local authorities can request it even more massively.  - the recruitment of 3,300 more contract workers;  - the use of supplementary lists;  - the recruitment of educational assistants and support staff for school principals.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220114193949/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/education"

Countries of the travellers origin are categorised as follows:     ""Green"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which no active circulation of the virus is observed and no variants of concern are identified. These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu. (previously, Argentina and Australia were on the Green list, but have moved to Orange)    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions. These are all countries/territories not included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries/territories. Reinforced measures are in force for travel between France and the United Kingdom. The Travel Advice sheet for the United Kingdom should be consulted.    ""Red"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus with the presence of variants of concern is observed. These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, the United States, Georgia, Mauritius, Montenegro, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey. (previously, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Zambia and Zimbabwe were on the Red list, and have now moved to Orange)    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom from 14 January:     - All travelers, vaccinated or not, must present a negative test (PCR or antigen test) taken less than 24 hours before travel  - For vaccinated travellers, there is no longer any obligation to justify a compelling reason to come to France, nor an obligation to respect a period of isolation on arrival on the national territory. As such, the need to register, prior to travel, on the digital platform ""eOS passenger"" is lifted. Screenings on arrival may be conducted at the places of arrival. In the event of a positive result, the traveller will be placed in solitary confinement.  - For unvaccinated travellers, travel to or from the United Kingdom is permitted provided that it can prove compelling reasons valid for ""red"" countries.  - Unvaccinated travellers from the United Kingdom must continue to register, before their departure, on the eOS passenger digital platform, allowing them to enter the address of their stay in France. They must, upon arrival in France, observe a strict quarantine period of 10 days at this place; this quarantine will be controlled by law enforcement.    Specific guidance for UK passengers is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202519/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/deplacements#voyager_dans_l'union_europeenne    Passengers from Green List countries are divided into two groups:     1. Member States of the European Union, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Holy See and Switzerland - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a test (PCR or antigenic) of less than 24 hours. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    2. Bahrain, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, The United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Vanuatu:  All travelers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status,from these countries/territories must present for boarding, the negative result of a PCR test or an antigen test (TAG) carried out less than 48 hours before the flight.

This obligation does not apply to the travel of road transport professionals in the exercise of their activity and to the following trips by land:    Journeys of less than 24 hours within a perimeter defined by a radius of 30 kilometres around the place of residence;  Business travel whose urgency or frequency is incompatible with the performance of a test or screening examination.  1.2: for Bahrain, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu:  All travellers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status, from these countries/territories must present a negative PCR test or antigen test (GAD) taken less than 48 hours before the flight for boarding.

For unvaccinated travellers from the UK, the time to complete the PCR or antigenic test is 24 hours.    All travelers will be eligible for an antigen test upon arrival. In addition:    - vaccinated travellers (full vaccination schedule) are not subject to the regime of compelling reasons.  - unvaccinated travellers are subject to the imperative grounds regime and will have to commit to a 7-day self-isolation and undergo a test at the end of this period. The list of compelling reasons is specified in the travel and travel certificate issued by the Ministry of the Interior.

COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice, and travellers to Tajikistan are strongly encouraged to check the specifics with their airline, including the timeframes for undertaking COVID-19 PCR tests, before travel.    Entry to Tajikistan  Land border crossings between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China and Afghanistan are closed to travellers. A small number of border points with Uzbekistan are open to Tajik citizens only. Some border points with Uzbekistan, China and Kyrgyzstan are open for cargo only. Flights are operating from several destinations. See International Travel section for further details.    Testing / screening on arrival  Travellers arriving in Tajikistan will be screened and be required to have a PCR test on arrival.    Quarantine requirements  Travellers entering Tajikistan are not currently subject to quarantine but are required to self-isolate for at least three days upon arrival; this may be subject to change.    Testing on departure  A âfit-to-flyâ negative PCR result is required to enable travellers to board flights at Dushanbe Airport. Additionally, most destinations and transits require travellers to have a negative PCR test before departing Tajikistan. Travellers should check the regulations at their destination and any transit points and obtain the required tests before travel. Travellers may be screened by having their temperature taken and assessed for other COVID-19 symptoms on departure from Tajikistan.        https://web.archive.org/web/20220103124453/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/entry-requirements"
