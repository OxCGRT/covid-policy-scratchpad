The Government of Andorra is therefore currently applying no restrictions on entering the country, nor on the movement of people and vehicles around its territory.    Everyone travelling to Andorra is exempt from having to complete a period of quarantine on arrival there.    •	From 9 December, the Government of Andorra has decreed that all tourists who spend 3 or more nights in the country and who are over 6 years of age, will be asked to prove they have tested negative (in a PCR or TMA) in the 72 hours before they arrive in Andorra. Admission to tourist accommodation will therefore also be conditional upon showing a negative result.    The supporting document must be the original, it can be written in Catalan, Spanish, French and/or English and can be submitted either in paper or electronic format. The document must contain at least the following information: the name of the tourist, their passport or identity card number (which must match the one used in their travel documents), the date on which the test was carried out, the identification and contact details of the centre which carried out the analysis, the test technique used and its negative result.     •	Visitors coming from France, Spain and Portugal are exempt from submitting a test due to the health agreements between Andorra and these countries. Similarly, tourists coming from countries considered as being in the ‘green zone’, or from countries whose test ratio for the population of their territory is greater than 5,000 tests carried out per 100,000 inhabitants per week or with less than 9% of their total number of tests being positive, will also be exempt.     •	However, residents of Spain, France or Portugal are advised to obtain a travel document from their Social Security office. People of other nationalities are advised to take out private travel insurance to provide coverage against COVID-19 or other possible incidents during their stay in Andorra.    https://archive.vn/0a76u    It is worth noting that in effect travel restrictions in place in France and Spain determine who can travel to Andorra, since all travel into Andorra requires transit via neighbouring France or Spain.  https://archive.vn/ybv4u"

The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

It also announced that businesses forced to close temporarily as a a cause of disease measures would be supported by the government in December and January by waived and taking over two-thirds of wage costs. In addition to catering, hotels and tourism, the remission of contributions and wage subsidies will be extended to private bus companies that are forced to take a break.
