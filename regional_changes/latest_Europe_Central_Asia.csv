Quarantine ends:  Quarantine can be shortened to 5 days if you go for sampling, otherwise quarantine is 14 days.  You will automatically receive a barcode for the sampling, you do not need to register specifically for it.  A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted. Households can then expect a quarantine day longer than isolation lasts. In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211220222329/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi"
