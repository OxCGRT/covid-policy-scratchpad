Persons with COVID-19 symptoms should isolate and get tested as quickly as possible.  2. Anyone with symptoms should be kept separate from the other children, pupils, students and employees until they can be collected or sent home, and all of the probable contact points must be cleaned (e.g. the seating in the classroom, doorknobs, handles, handrails etc., that the person or child with symptoms may have touched).  A negative PCR test will mean the tested person or child is no longer suspected of having COVID-19.  If it is ascertained there is infection among the pupils or teachers, the next steps will be clarified in collaboration with the municipality and the National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) in accordance with the applicable rules for the area.    Basic principles for handling cases in relation to primary schools and day care institutions:  1.The day care institution or primary school should not allow any child or pupil who is infected or who is a close contact of an infected child or pupil from attending the institution or primary school.  2. The pupils can be tested, if required several times, rather than sending them home. The times for testing will depend on the specific case.  3. Children who do not have COVID-19 symptoms and whose parents do not want them to be tested, are recommended to remain at home for 14 days after their last near contact with the infected person.  4. Parents or other family members or people who live with the children who are near contacts, only need to pay extra attention to the infection prevention advice, including in relation to hygiene and airing out.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206122147/https://corona.nun.gl/en/at-the-workplace/guidelines-for-primary-schools-day-care-and-after-school-activities/"

This recommendation is based on several reasons:  -COVID-19 is continuing to evolve into new variants. By vaccinating most people and children aged 12 to 15, society achieves extra immunity and therefore better control of the epidemic.  -The vaccine is effective at preventing children from becoming ill with COVID-19. However, children are rarely seriously ill from COVID-19.  -Vaccinated children help to break chains of infection, since they have less risk of becoming infected and of passing the infection to others. They help to protect other people, such as the elderly and vulnerable families who are not vaccinated.  -The increased immunity in the population means children and adults can return to more normal daily routines without the need for testing and tracing.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211202105100/https://corona.nun.gl/en/vaccination-against-covid-19/vaccination-for-children-aged-12-years/"
