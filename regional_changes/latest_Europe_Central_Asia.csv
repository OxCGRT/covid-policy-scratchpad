"26","Albania","ALB",2022-02-22,"Europe_Central_Asia","E1: Income support","1G","1G","The government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable which were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 98 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.    The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.    In September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employersâ share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.    /web/20220301071254/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test).    Vaccinated visitors  Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry. If there is no evidence of a negative PCR test at the time of entry, registration must be made via the pre-travel clearance and home quarantine must be initiated immediately and until a negative test result is available.    **Entry into Austria and pre-travel clearance**  The linchpin of the COVID-19 entry regulation 2021 is the 2G+ proof : For each type of entry, proof of vaccination or recovery  with an additional negative PCR test is required. This also includes the EU Digital COVID Certificates , which are provided with an EU - compliant QR code . All vaccinations that have been approved by the EMA or the corresponding WHO process are recognized as proof of vaccination have passed successfully. Stricter rules apply when entering the country from virus variant areas and states.    Second vaccinations and each subsequent vaccination are recognized up to 270 days after administration.  There must be at least 14 days between the 1st and 2nd vaccination and at least 120 days between the 2nd and 3rd vaccination.    The COVID-19 entry regulation 2021 basically provides for two categories:  1. Entry from states and areas that are not virus variant areas and states: 2G+, no quarantine  Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account  . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry. If there is no evidence of a negative PCR test at the time of entry, registration must be made via the pre-travel clearance and home quarantine must be initiated immediately and until a negative test result is available.    People who have already received another dose of "" booster"" do not have to carry a PCR test with them.  Only a document issued in Latin script in German or English ( e.g.  yellow vaccination card) on vaccination with a vaccine that has been approved  by the  EMA  or has successfully passed the  EUL process  of the  WHO  (vaccines according to Annex C ). The  EU  Digital COVID  Certificates , which have an  EU - compliant  QR code , also count as proof of vaccination are provided. A certificate of recovery is a medical or official confirmation ( e.g. notice  of separation) in Latin script in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past 180 days.    Citizens and persons resident in Austria as well as  EU / EEA citizens and persons resident or habitually resident in an EU / EEA state who can not provide valid 2G proof must register via the pre-travel Clearance and quarantine for 10 days. The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test).    The obligation to carry a negative result of a molecular biological test or a medical certificate of such does not apply to recovered persons who can present a medical certificate in accordance with Annex H or Annex I. However, the quarantine obligation remains in place. The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test) or, in the case of a positive molecular biological test result, by re-submission of a medical certificate in accordance with Annex H or Annex I.    When entering the country as part of regular commuter traffic for professional purposes, to participate in school and study, for family purposes or to visit a partner, proof in the sense of the 3-G must be provided. The result of an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 also applies here , with the exception of one for self-testing, or a medical certificate of such a test as proof of a low epidemiological risk. This also applies to the ""Ninja Pass"" with regard to people who are subject to general compulsory education. Results of an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2and medical certificates for such lose their validity if the sample was taken more than 24 hours before the time of entry.

The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test).    Vaccinated visitors  Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry. If there is no evidence of a negative PCR test at the time of entry, registration must be made via the pre-travel clearance and home quarantine must be initiated immediately and until a negative test result is available.    **Entry into Austria and pre-travel clearance**  The linchpin of the COVID-19 entry regulation 2021 is the 2G+ proof : For each type of entry, proof of vaccination or recovery  with an additional negative PCR test is required. This also includes the EU Digital COVID Certificates , which are provided with an EU - compliant QR code . All vaccinations that have been approved by the EMA or the corresponding WHO process are recognized as proof of vaccination have passed successfully. Stricter rules apply when entering the country from virus variant areas and states.    Second vaccinations and each subsequent vaccination are recognized up to 270 days after administration.  There must be at least 14 days between the 1st and 2nd vaccination and at least 120 days between the 2nd and 3rd vaccination.    The COVID-19 entry regulation 2021 basically provides for two categories:  1. Entry from states and areas that are not virus variant areas and states: 2G+, no quarantine  Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account  . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry. If there is no evidence of a negative PCR test at the time of entry, registration must be made via the pre-travel clearance and home quarantine must be initiated immediately and until a negative test result is available.    People who have already received another dose of "" booster"" do not have to carry a PCR test with them.  Only a document issued in Latin script in German or English ( e.g.  yellow vaccination card) on vaccination with a vaccine that has been approved  by the  EMA  or has successfully passed the  EUL process  of the  WHO  (vaccines according to Annex C ). The  EU  Digital COVID  Certificates , which have an  EU - compliant  QR code , also count as proof of vaccination are provided. A certificate of recovery is a medical or official confirmation ( e.g. notice  of separation) in Latin script in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past 180 days.    Citizens and persons resident in Austria as well as  EU / EEA citizens and persons resident or habitually resident in an EU / EEA state who can not provide valid 2G proof must register via the pre-travel Clearance and quarantine for 10 days. The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test).    The obligation to carry a negative result of a molecular biological test or a medical certificate of such does not apply to recovered persons who can present a medical certificate in accordance with Annex H or Annex I. However, the quarantine obligation remains in place. The quarantine can be ended from the fifth day after entry (day of entry = day ""zero"") with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR test) or, in the case of a positive molecular biological test result, by re-submission of a medical certificate in accordance with Annex H or Annex I.    When entering the country as part of regular commuter traffic for professional purposes, to participate in school and study, for family purposes or to visit a partner, proof in the sense of the 3-G must be provided. The result of an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 also applies here , with the exception of one for self-testing, or a medical certificate of such a test as proof of a low epidemiological risk. This also applies to the ""Ninja Pass"" with regard to people who are subject to general compulsory education. Results of an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2and medical certificates for such lose their validity if the sample was taken more than 24 hours before the time of entry.

Exempt from this COVID certificate requirement are:    Religious ceremonies, funerals, events that fall within the scope of the normal activities and services of public authorities, political events and self-help groups with up to 50 people. For these indoor events, masks must be worn, the consumption of food and drinks is banned.  Blood donation campaigns are not considered events and are therefore not subject to the COVID certificate requirement. The current precautionary measures continue to apply to these campaigns.  Basically masks must be worn for all events indoors. Where neither wearing masks nor compulsory seating is possible, only vaccinated or recovered people who can present a certificate for a negative test result (2G+) are admitted.    You will find more detailed information on the various areas of application of the COVID certificate and the exceptions on the Use of the COVID certificate page.    Outdoors    At outdoor events, access for people aged 16 and over is also restricted to people who are vaccinated or recovered (2G). The organiser can voluntarily limit access to vaccinated or recovered people who also have a certificate for a negative test result (2G+).Access restrictions can be waived if not more than 300 people are admitted and guests do not dance.

Three main changes now apply:     - The end of the obligation to wear a mask outdoors for elementary school students and staff;  - The possibility of practicing physical and sports activities indoors again without wearing a mask (respecting a distance: contact sports are therefore not allowed without a mask);  - The lightening of the rules limiting social mixing (by level or group of classes rather than by class), especially during break times.    In addition, legal guardians of students who have been in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case in their class will no longer be obliged to send a signed ""Declaration of Honour"" that their child has completed the proscribed regime of self-testing in order for them to return to school after isolation, and that testing regime will be relaxed to one self-test rather than two from 28 February.

These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Taiwan and Vanuatu.  - ""Orange"" countries: countries in which there is an active circulation of the virus in controlled proportions, without diffusion of worrying variants. These are not all countries included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries.  - ""Red"" countries: countries in which active circulation of the virus is observed with the presence of variants of concern. Currently, there are no countries classified as ""red"".  - ""Scarlet red"" countries: countries in which a particularly active circulation of the virus and the discovery of a variant likely to present a risk of increased transmissibility or immune escape are observed. Currently, there is no country classified as ""scarlet red"".    In orer to enter France, travelers must comply with rules specific to their country of departure:     1: travelers from a country/territory classified as ""green""  - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a PCR test of less than 72 hours or antigenic test (TAG) of less than 48 hours.  - This obligation does not apply to the travel of road transport professionals in the exercise of their activity and to the following trips by land:  -- Journeys of less than 24 hours within a perimeter defined by a radius of 30 kilometres around the place of residence;  -- Business travel whose urgency or frequency is incompatible with the performance of a test or screening examination.    2: Travellers from a country/territory classified as ""orange"": all countries/territories other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 (""green"")  Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a PCR test of less than 72 hours or antigenic test (TAG) of less than 48 hours. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    In addition:     - vaccinated travellers (full vaccination schedule) are not subject to the regime of compelling reasons.  - unvaccinated travellers are subject to the imperative grounds regime and will have to commit to a 7-day self-isolation and undergo a test at the end of this period. The list of compelling reasons is specified in the travel and travel certificate issued by the Ministry of the Interior. Under this list, the following may enter France: the French, their spouses and children, nationals of the European area as well as their spouses and children having their main residence in France or who join, in transit through France, their main residence in a country of the European area or the country of which they are nationals.    Whilst no countries are currently specified as Red or Scarlet Red, nnvaccinated travellers from these countries/territories would still be subject to the regime of compelling reasons for entering France, must present at boarding a negative result of a PCR test or an antigen test (TAG) carried out less than 48 hours before the flight, will be subject to a mandatory antigen test upon arrival, and would be subject to a mandatory 10-day quarantine,controlled by the security forces.     - https://web.archive.org/web/20220213064422/https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/informations-pratiques/article/coronavirus-covid-19     The specific rule requiring travelers from the United Kingdom to present results of a Covid-19 test taken within 24 hours of departure (rather than the usual 48 hours requires for travelers from other Orange list countries) has been rescinded as of 12 February. https://web.archive.org/web/20220213064422/https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/informations-pratiques/article/coronavirus-covid-19 and https://web.archive.org/web/20220221213430/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements"

"1231","Kazakhstan","KAZ",2022-02-09,"Europe_Central_Asia","V1: Vaccine Prioritisation","-3","-3","11/3/22  Vaccination against the coronavirus has been started since February 1, 2021. What is meant here is the Russian âSputnik Vâ vaccine produced by Karaganda pharmaceutical complex. âSputnik Vâ is the world`s first registered vaccine for prevention of the coronavirus infection. It was developed in the N. Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology under the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The two-component vaccine was developed based on a human adenovirus vector. In Kazakhstan, the Russian vaccine is produced by Karaganda pharmaceutical complex. To be more precise, the substance is delivered from Russia while in Kazakhstan the substance is processed into a finished pharma product. Kazakhstani stocks and raw materials are used. Mass vaccination will start from March 2021. The vaccine won`t be provided free-of-charge to all the Kazakhstani citizens. The citizens can apply for a free-of-charge vaccination within the statutory free-of-charge medical assistance. The Kazakhstani vaccine is called QazCovid-in. That is an inactivated vaccine, which was developed in May 2020.    Who will be vaccinated first?    During the first stages, the vaccine will be provided to people from the risk categories. If the volume of the vaccine allows, then the rest of Kazakhstani citizens will also be able to get the vaccine.    The following individuals with a high risk of contracting the coronavirus infection (priority-based order) are subject to the vaccination against the coronavirus:    medical employees, first of all employees of infectious diseases hospitals, ambulances, resuscitation and intensive care units, health care organizations providing primary health care, emergency rooms of health care organizations providing inpatient care, employees of the sanitary and epidemiological service;  teachers;  district police officers;  students;  personnel of medical and social as well as private childcare centers;  employees of Emergency Situations Service, Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal Affairs, National Security Committee, State Security Service of the Republic of Kazakhstan;  employees of Presidential Affairs Department of the Republic of Kazakhstan, civil servants, citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan working for the diplomatic and consular missions accredited in Kazakhstan, members of national teams;  people with the chronic diseases (diabetes, chronic obstructive     pulmonary and heart diseases).  Where the vaccination is performed?    Vaccination of citizens takes place in the vaccination facilities of local medical organizations.  Vaccination of specialized groups is performed at the place of service of a relevant agency.In certain cases (low population size, lack of a stationary vaccination premise, lack of refrigeration equipment with a low temperature regime), mobile vaccination facilities or mobile vaccination teams are arranged for vaccination.     A vaccination team is assembled in each vaccination facility with regard to a daily workload per 1 team, which is no more than 60 vaccines (for mobile teams no more than 40 vaccines).     Thus, 1 vaccination team consists of 1 doctor, 1 treatment nurse and 1 registrar if required.    In rural areas, a vaccination team can consist of 1 rural paramedic (if there is no doctor), 1 treatment nurse and 1 registrar if required.The vaccines that were done are registered in the established registration forms (a separate register of preventive vaccinations against COVID, a vaccination record card, a patient's medical record, a vaccination section of the medical information system) with indication of the date of vaccination, type of vaccination (component I or II), manufacturer, batch number, vaccine reaction.    It is planned that an electronic vaccination passport will be introduced.    An electronic vaccination passport is a document certifying that a person got preventive vaccines. It will provide information on medications a person received, doses, the dates and also, whether there were any reactions after a vaccination.       As soon as a person will get a vaccine against the coronavirus infection, information about it will become available in the eGov mobile app.     Who won`t be vaccinated against the coronavirus?    Vaccination against the coronavirus in Kazakhstan is contraindicated to children under 18 and people over 65 due to the lack of data on its efficiency and safety.    Individuals with permanent and temporary medical contraindications to the preventive vaccines are not subject to vaccination against COVID pursuant to the Order of Minister of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan as of October 21, 2020 No. KR DSM-146/2020 âOn Approval of the List of Medical Contraindications to Carry Preventive Vaccinationsâ.     Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment and patients with an immune deficiency may not develop a sufficient immune response. Therefore, taking drugs that suppress the function of the immune system is contraindicated for at least 1 month before and after vaccination due to the risk of decreased immunogenicity. Therefore, intake of medical products that suppress the immune system function is contraindicated for at least 1 month prior and after vaccination due to the risk of decreased immunogenicity.    Individuals suffering from an acute and symptomless COVID forms are not subject to vaccination.Individuals who had a contact with those suffering from infectious diseases, including COVID, get the vaccine after a quarantine.No screening is performed prior to vaccination to check antibodies against COVID (EIA and PCR research).  It is recommended to vaccinated those who suffered from any COVID forms in 6 months after convalescence with regard to health assessment prior to vaccination.       Can one withdraw from a vaccine?    It is possible to withdraw from the vaccine against the coronavirus. The vaccination is carried out on a voluntary basis with provision of consent by a person getting a vaccine.      Pursuant to the Article 77 of the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan ""On People's Health and Healthcare System"", Kazakhstani citizens have a right to withdraw from preventive vaccines.      https://web.archive.org/web/20220311083700/https://egov.kz/cms/en/articles/health_care/Vakcinaciya-protiv-koronavirusnoy-infekcii-"
