Slovenia,SVN,Europe_Central_Asia,20200929,E1: Income support,1,1,1A,1A,"At today's correspondence session, the Government adopted a proposal for the Intervention Measures Act to mitigate and eliminate the consequences of COVID-19 or the so-called fifth anti-crown package.    The bill for employees extends the measure of 100 percent compensation of salary in the case of ordered quarantine due to contact with an infected person at work. From 1 September 2020 onwards, it will be possible to claim 80% compensation in the event of absence from work due to child protection due to force majeure (child quarantine).  For employers, the possibility of reimbursing compensation for wages paid for absence from work due to the ordered quarantine is extended. In addition, they are relieved of the possibility of reimbursement of salary compensation due to absence from work due to childcare (force majeure).  The press release issued by the government late last night indicated no major changes to the previous version of the bill, which entails measures for healthcare, labour, social security, economy, education, justice, criminal sanctions, agriculture and infrastructure. Previous policies still in place with the fifth package, hence 1A maintained. https://web.archive.org/web/20201001180911/https://www.gov.si/novice/2020-09-29-98-dopisna-seja-vlade-republike-slovenije/ https://web.archive.org/web/20201001185704/https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/news/7057-morning-headlines-for-slovenia"
