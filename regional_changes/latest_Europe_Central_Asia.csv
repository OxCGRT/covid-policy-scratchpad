For more information, visit their website.  Public Health Labs:  Currently, to be tested for COVID-19 by the Albanian public health authority one must have symptoms and a recommendation from the public health authorityâs family doctor.  However, private testing labs will perform a test for a fee, and no symptoms or a doctorâs recommendation is required (see details below).  If you have an Albanian social security number, you also have an assigned public health family doctor.  To learn who your public health family doctor is, call the help line at 0-800-4040 to find out.  Tests are free of charge if done by the Albanian Institute of Public Health (IPH).  Private Labs:  Individuals can also arrange private testing by going to a private testing lab. No symptoms or doctorâs order is required to arrange a private test, and no advance appointment is necessary.  According to the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are several private labs authorized to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing for administrative issues.

"60","Austria","AUT",2022-05-16,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1. Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for people with symptoms is still 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2. Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for accompanying persons and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3. Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month:  	o	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  	o	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  	o	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.    For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.    At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.    The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.    Sources:  https://archive.ph/UbxYM  https://archive.ph/OYeVj"

The central bank suggested banks defer loan repayments of firms in sectors affected by COVID-19. Subsequently, state-owned banks extended deadlines for loan repayments for affected sectors, including for the national air carrier. The central bank reduced its policy rate by 200 basis points in 2020. The policy rate was reduced from 16 to 15 percent on April 15, and from 15 to 14 percent on September 8. While the central bank has not changed requirements for regulatory capital or liquidity, it delayed phasing in tighter liquidity regulations and restricted banksâ dividend distributions. In October 2020, the authorities recommended that banks consider further deferral of loan repayments on a case by case basis.  http://web.archive.org/web/20220519160445/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
