This royal decree establishes the areas where the mask will continue to be mandatory. However, it is recommended for all people with a greater vulnerability to COVID-19 infection to maintain the use of a mask in any situation in which there is prolonged contact with people at a distance of less than 1.5 meters.    For this reason, responsible use of the mask is recommended in closed spaces for public use in which people transit or spend a long time. Likewise, the responsible use of the mask in crowded events is recommended. In the family environment and in private gatherings or celebrations, responsible use is recommended based on the vulnerability of the participants.    In the work environment, in general, the use of masks will not be mandatory. However, those responsible for occupational risk prevention, in accordance with the corresponding risk assessment of the job, may determine the appropriate preventive measures that must be implemented in the workplace or in certain areas of the work centers, including the possible use of masks, if this is derived from the aforementioned evaluation.    Consequently, the mandatory use of a mask is maintained, first of all, in health centers, services and establishments, since these are areas where there may be a greater concentration of vulnerable people in whom the risk of serious illness is greater and, on the other hand, where the probability of transmission is higher, since they are places where there may be a greater number of people with communicable respiratory infections, in addition to COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220503180420/https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2022-6449"

"203","Spain","ESP",2022-06-06,"Europe_Central_Asia","E1: Income support","2T","2T","Similar to Switzerland there is an extension for the tourism industry until the end of June    The Spanish government has finally backed down and agreed to extend the furlough scheme which was introduced at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but only until 31 March and not until June as some sectors had requested. The furloughs resulting from the volcanic eruption on La Palma, in the Canary Islands, will however continue until June and possibly beyond.    However, the conditions for this short-term extension of the pandemic furlough scheme will not be exactly the same, as 20 per cent fewer companies will benefit from the exemptions from Social Security contributions. For furloughed workers, though, nothing will change. Nearly 105,000 people are in this situation, either from the pandemic or the volcanic eruption.    There will also be a special protection mechanism for travel agencies, as this sector has been worst-hit by the pandemic and will need considerable time to recover. Nearly 10,800 workers in this industry are furloughed at present, and that is almost one in three. Next month the government will approve a scheme specifically for these workers. Companies will be able to activate this mechanism for up to one year, and can then extend it twice for six months at a time if necessary.    The CC OO union has welcomed the agreement and asked the government to also extend the Me Cuida Plan until 30 June, which it has agreed to do.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000226/https://www.surinenglish.com/spain/government-extends-furlough-20220222113506-nt.html"

If during your stay in Spain you develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) or other symptoms compatible with COVID-19 such as reduced sense of smell and taste, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, general weakness, diarrhea or vomiting, you must commit to:    Self-isolating: staying at home or place of accommodation and self-isolating in a room. Preferably in a room for individual use, which is well ventilated and with an individual bathroom. If this is not possible, the safety distance of 1.5 metres should be guaranteed and a surgical mask should be worn when in contact with other people living with the patient. Be very careful with hygiene.  Contact the health service: contact the competent health authorities of the Autonomous Communities by telephone. If you feeling that the illness is serious, you have shortness of breath or chest pain, call 112.  What should I do if I had had close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 during my stay in Spain?  If you have had close contact with a COVID-19 case and you are not vaccinated with a complete vaccination regimen, you should quarantine: if you have had close contact with a patient with COVID-19 or someone suspected of having it without adequate protective measures, from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you should quarantine for 7 days staying in your home or place of accommodation, preferably in a room on your own. During the following 10 days after the last contact, protection measures should be stepped up (use of masks, limiting the number of social contacts, etc).
