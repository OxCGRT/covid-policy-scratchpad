Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450.

Use alcohol-based disinfectants (minimum 70%).  Clean contact points in buildings at least three times a day, such as door handles, window handles, faucets in toilets and kitchens, cistern buttons, remote controls, power switches, door bells, elevator buttons, reception desks and more touch surfaces used by a large number of people.  Touching contaminated surfaces by employees and clients is one of the main ways the COVID-19 virus spreads.  Clean all touch surfaces at least twice a day: desktops, smartphones and other phones, laptops, keyboards, and computers according to user instructions.  Meeting rooms, trainings and other areas where a large number of people gather should be cleaned after each meeting.  Place hand sanitizers in visible places everywhere in the work environment, especially in public places where people have fewer opportunities to wash their hands regularly. Ensure that these funds are regularly updated.  For hand washing in toilets, provide warm running water and soap, as well as disposable paper towels.  Install waste bins with lids to safely dispose of used paper towels and other waste in toilets and other rooms.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220327182232/https://covid19.fmoh.gov.ba/preporuke"

You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.    The Tajikistan national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) and Sinovac vaccines. The Tajikistan authorities have stated that British nationals resident in Tajikistan are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. Further information is available on the Ministry of Health website    Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.    If youâre a British national living in Tajikistan, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220411094017/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/coronavirus    Which vaccines are available in TAJIKISTAN?

Please contact the clinic directly for information about cost and availability.  The quality of Tajikistanâs medical infrastructure is significantly below Western standards, with shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics.  Due to extremely limited vaccine availability, we strongly recommend that travelers complete their COVID-19 vaccination before traveling to Tajikistan.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220409143707/https://tj.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
