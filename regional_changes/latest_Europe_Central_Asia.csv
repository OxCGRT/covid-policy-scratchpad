If you have an Albanian social security number, you also have an assigned public health family doctor.  To learn who your public health family doctor is, call the help line at 0-800-4040 to find out.  Tests are free of charge if done by the Albanian Institute of Public Health (IPH).  Private Labs:  Individuals can also arrange private testing by going to a private testing lab. No symptoms or doctorâs order is required to arrange a private test, and no advance appointment is necessary.  According to the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are several private labs authorized to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing for administrative issues. For a full list, please see the Ministry of Health list here.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220121115604/https://al.usembassy.gov/updates_covid19/"

Countries of the travellers origin are categorised as follows:     ""Green"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which no active circulation of the virus is observed and no variants of concern are identified. These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu. (previously, Argentina and Australia were on the Green list, but have moved to Orange)    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions. These are all countries/territories not included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries/territories. Reinforced measures are in force for travel between France and the United Kingdom. The Travel Advice sheet for the United Kingdom should be consulted.    ""Red"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus with the presence of variants of concern is observed. These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, the United States, Georgia, Mauritius, Montenegro, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey. (previously, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Zambia and Zimbabwe were on the Red list, and have now moved to Orange)    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom from 14 January:     - All travelers, vaccinated or not, must present a negative test (PCR or antigen test) taken less than 24 hours before travel  - For vaccinated travellers, there is no longer any obligation to justify a compelling reason to come to France, nor an obligation to respect a period of isolation on arrival on the national territory. As such, the need to register, prior to travel, on the digital platform ""eOS passenger"" is lifted. Screenings on arrival may be conducted at the places of arrival. In the event of a positive result, the traveller will be placed in solitary confinement.  - For unvaccinated travellers, travel to or from the United Kingdom is permitted provided that it can prove compelling reasons valid for ""red"" countries.  - Unvaccinated travellers from the United Kingdom must continue to register, before their departure, on the eOS passenger digital platform, allowing them to enter the address of their stay in France. They must, upon arrival in France, observe a strict quarantine period of 10 days at this place; this quarantine will be controlled by law enforcement.    Specific guidance for UK passengers is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202519/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/deplacements#voyager_dans_l'union_europeenne    Passengers from Green List countries are divided into two groups:     1. Member States of the European Union, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Holy See and Switzerland - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a test (PCR or antigenic) of less than 24 hours. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    2. Bahrain, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, The United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Vanuatu:  All travelers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status,from these countries/territories must present for boarding, the negative result of a PCR test or an antigen test (TAG) carried out less than 48 hours before the flight.

The need for meetings must be assessed, particularly if there are many attendees. Such meetings should preferably be held using teleconferencing equipment whenever possible. This also applies to meetings within the company if possible. Care must be taken as regards employee travel overseas. Then ecessity of travel must be assessed each time, and employees should avoid such travel unless it is unavoidable.    It is important that managers encourage their employees to take care of their health and to stay at home if they experience any illness. Employees with underlying illnesses are particularly at risk from the virus and should, therefore, consult with their superior as to the possibility of working from home as much as possible if that is an option.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110105656/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/workplaces"

"1210","Iceland","ISL",2022-01-11,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","16/01/22  Three types of COVID-tests are in use. PCR-tests are used by the health care system to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, and when people might be infected. Rapid antigen tests are also used in the health care system and by certified test centers, both before events, but also at the beginning and end of special precaution. Self-tests people can buy in stores are not deemed reliable. A postitive result should always be confirmed with a PCR test.    Information on centres for COVID-19 PCR or rapid antigen tests  PCR-test - Symptom testing:  If you have symptoms or suspect you have an infection, you should be tested even if you have been vaccinated.  Stay at home and register immediately for testing on My Page at Heilsuvera. If you do not have an electronic ID, you can contact, by telephone, your local healthcare centre, LÃ¦knavaktin 1700 (the on-call medical hotline) or the Heilsuvera online chat. If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or LÃ¦knavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.  Symptom testing is always free of charge, for tourists as well.  Rapid antigen test - testing for asymptomatic people  Rapid antigen tests are used to screen for COVID-19 virus with asymptomatic people. If you suspect you have an infection, you should have a PCR-test.  Self-tests  Self-tests are not deemed reliable. If you test positive on a self-test, you should go for a PCR test (free) immediatly and follow the rules on isolation until your results are ready.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220116183316/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/testing-due-to-symptoms"
