Further information can be found on the website of the  Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF).""    *Universities*  Does the â3-G ruleâ - tested, recovered, vaccinated - also apply to universities and colleges?Inhalt zuklappen  In any case, it is recommended that the so-called ""3-G rule"" also authorize access to universities and colleges. As in other areas of life, those who have been tested, recovered and vaccinated should be granted access to the campus. For this, the current legal basis, the 2nd COVID-19 University Act , has been extended to the upcoming winter semester 2021/22 until February 28, 2022 and adjusted accordingly. The 3G rule is particularly relevant for participation in face-to-face courses, face-to-face exams or participation in selection, aptitude and admission procedures on site . The proven approach remains that the University and college managements are responsible for determining the specific corona measures at their locations. They know the respective conditions and requirements on site best. However, they have to guarantee the applicable level of protection, for which the current, general corona protection and hygiene measures offer a valuable basis.     Therefore, please inform yourself directly at your respective university or college how they organize their teaching and examination operations and which Corona measures they intend to take.    The 3-G rule states:     The 2nd COVID-19 Opening Ordinance defines precise criteria as to when one belongs to the group of people who have a ""low epidemiological risk"".   - Anyone who has been vaccinated with a centrally approved COVID-19 vaccine is considered vaccinated. The first vaccination counts from the 22nd day after the 1st prick for a maximum of three months from the time of vaccination. After the 2nd bite you are immunized for a total of 20 days. Vaccines for which only one vaccination is intended (e.g. from Johnson & Johnson) are valid from the 22nd day after the vaccination for a total of 270 days. This also applies to people who can be proven to have recovered as soon as they have received the first stitch.   - As tested applies to those who can provide evidence of a negative PCR test or a negative antigen test. PCR tests are valid for 72 hours from the time the sample is taken, and antigen tests for 48 hours if performed by an authorized body. Self-tests that are recorded in an official data processing system in the federal states are valid for 24 hours. In addition, there are exceptionally supervised point-of-sale tests for one-time entry of sports facilities, business premises, restaurants, hotels or an event.  - As recovered applies to those who can present a separation notice of a SARS-COV-2 infection or a medical confirmation within the last six months. Alternatively, a corresponding antibody test can be presented, which, however, must not be older than three months.  You can find more detailed information about the 3-G rule and the other applicable protective and hygiene measures on the website of the Federal Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) .

As of Oct. 12, entry is permitted for UK travelers arriving from the UK, a European Union member state, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland provided they present a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival, as well as a certificate of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery; travelers that do not possess a certificate indicating COVID-19 vaccination or recovery may enter Bulgaria but must self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival.    Authorities have also moved France, Monaco, Portugal, Cyprus, and Iceland into the green list of countries while moving Malaysia, Eswatini, Iran, Macedonia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, the U.S., and Ireland to the orange list of countries. Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, and Singapore are to be considered red-list countries from Oct. 13.    Authorities in Bulgaria classify countries as green, orange, or red based on local disease activity and accordingly apply differing entry restrictions. Travelers from green and orange countries can enter upon presenting a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document confirming vaccination against COVID-19, recovery from COVID-19, or a recent negative test for the disease. Travelers without such documentation must isolate for 10 days on arrival, though isolation can be ended early following receipt of a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours after arrival.    Travel from red countries is permitted for EU citizens, their families, and persons traveling for selected essential purposes only. Permitted travelers from red countries must present a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document indicating vaccination against or recovery from COVID-19, in addition to a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival and certified by a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document. Limited categories of travelers are permitted to enter by only satisfying the PCR test requirement, but must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival.      Citizens and residents of Romania, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, and North Macedonia who also travel daily or weekly to Bulgaria for work or study may enter the country without restrictions; these travelers do not need to show COVID-19-related documentation to enter Bulgaria.

On the same day, the government also introduced a ban on leaving oneâs home municipality (these are 212 small territorial areas with a median number of inhabitants of around 5,000; the smallest two municipalities have some 350 inhabitants) [32]. There were some exceptions, such as crossing over the boundaries of a municipality to visit family members in need of protection, assistance, support, or nursing care. Crossing between municipalities was also allowed for the purpose of visiting, e.g., grocery shops or pharmacies, if none existed in oneâs own municipality. The reason for moving between municipalities had to be proved with appropriate documents.    For the elderly population and those with physical disabilities, the introduced measure about visiting grocery stores was insufficient because they were unable to complete their shopping by 10 AM. Especially vulnerable were individuals whose social supporters all came from other municipalities. Therefore, representatives of different governmental and non-governmental organizations suggested extending the opening hours for vulnerable groups [33], as happened on April 4 [34], allowing them to also visit grocery stores in the last hour of opening.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247993"

"1597","Sweden","SWE",2021-10-10,"Europe_Central_Asia","H7: Vaccination policy","5G","5G","Groups:    Pregnant women  If you are pregnant, you can get vaccinated throughout your pregnancy. However, the Public Health Agency recommends that vaccination be given after pregnancy week 12, unless there are other reasons. For example, you may have a medical risk factor such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes or are over 35 years of age.    Most people who become ill with Covid-19 experience mild symptoms of illness and do not need to seek medical care. But pregnant women have a slightly higher risk of becoming seriously ill. Vaccination against Covid-19 is recommended for all pregnant women, as the vaccines provide good protection against serious illness and reduce the risk of early delivery.    About pregnancy and vaccines from the Public Health Agency    Children and young people   All people, twelve years and older, are offered Covid-19 vaccination.    Each region determines how they handle consent when vaccinating minors. Some regions send a consent form in connection with the booking, others make a maturity assessment at the time of vaccination.     The Swedish Public Health Agency has decided to suspend the use of Modernaâs Spikevax vaccine for everyone born in 1991 or later.    COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 12â15, The Public Health Agency of Sweden    Those with immunodeficiency  If you are over 18 years of age and have a severely impaired immune system due to a disease or medical treatment, it is recommended that you take an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It is your treating doctor who will prescribe the extra dose after an individual assessment.    The Elderly  The Swedish Public Health Agency (""FolkhÃ¤lsomyndigheten"") recommends that people at increased risk of severe Covid-19 be offered a vaccine booster. This includes those who live in care homes, those with home health care or home care and everyone who is 80 years and older. The third shot should be taken six months or more following the previous shot.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211010054857/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/vaccination-against-covid-19/when-is-it-my-turn"

If you test positive for COVID-19 will be placed into Red, Yellow and Green categories. If you have a light form of coronavirus infection (asymptomatic), you will be categorised as Green. If you have medium symptoms (e.g. high temperature), you will be categorised as Yellow, and if you have serious symptoms, you will be categorised as Red.    If you are categorised as Green or Yellow, and if approved by a doctor, then you will be allowed to have treatment at home and will be required to comply with existing sanitary-hygiene rules. In Red cases, you will be admitted to hospital. If you are categorised as Green or Yellow and treatment at home is not possible, you will be hospitalised in a dedicated government facility, and discharged after 10 days if no further symptoms are observed.    If you have been in contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19, you will no longer be automatically quarantined but are required to self-isolate for 14-days and be subject to medical monitoring.""
