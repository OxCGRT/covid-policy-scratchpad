The MNS is to be fixed either with rubber bands or fabric straps. The material has to form a mechanical barrier in order to avoid the splashing of droplets when speaking, coughing and sneezing. The use of face shields (so-called ""Face Shields"" or ""Mini Face Shields"") is not permitted. An exception for face visors applies to people who can show a medical certificate confirming that they cannot wear an MNS for health reasons (e.g. asthmatics).

Additional clarification:  Public transport users, with the exception of children up to the age of 12, are obliged to cover their mouths and noses by wearing a face mask or any other fabric alternative. This applies from the moment they enter the airport, station, at stops or on the platform, train or other means of transport organised by a public authority. If it is not possible to wear a face mask for medical reasons, a face shield can be worn. Public transport drivers are not required to cover their nose and mouth, insofar as the driver is well- isolated in a cabin on the one hand, and a poster and/or sticker indicates to users the reason why the driver is not wearing a mask on the other. This exception also applies, under the same conditions, to drivers of organised collective transport (e.g. school bus).

Private laboratories also offer testing, but this is not free.     The Luxembourg government is embarking on a new phase of screening with the aim to test representative samples of the population in order to monitor developments and to be as flexible as possible in the event of an increase in the number of cases. This is the best way to break infection chains and effectively trace the contacts of infected people.    The COVID-19 test at the invitation of the Luxembourg Government concerns residents and cross-border workers. It is free of charge.    The Large Scale Testing strategy divides people into representative groups, e.g. according to business sector, age and place of residence. This means that members of the same household, residents of a residential area or a circle of colleagues receive invitations deliberately staggered by several weeks according to the targeted samples. This also makes it possible to maintain continuous testing. It is therefore a strategy based on a large scale sampling approach. This organised exercise makes it possible to control and keep the rate of infections at a very low level and thus ensure the protection of everyone. The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and protects us all.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213106/https://covid19.public.lu/en/testing.html"
