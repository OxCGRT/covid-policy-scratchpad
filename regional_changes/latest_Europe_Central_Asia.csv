Previous coding note:   Rapid tests will be made available for the general public.  The national testing strategy will therefore be supplemented by the following measures, which are to be implemented step by step by the beginning of April:   -	In order to ensure safe school operations and safe childcare, the Länder will ensure that staff in schools and childcare facilities as well as all pupils receive the offer of at least one free rapid test per week of attendance as part of their testing concepts. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible.   -	For comprehensive protection against infection, it is necessary that companies in Germany offer at least one free rapid test per week to their employees who are present at work, as part of their overall contribution to society. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible. The Federal Government will discuss this with the business community later this week.   -	All asymptomatic citizens will be allowed a free rapid test at least once a week, including a certificate of the test result, at a testing centre operated by the respective Land or municipality, at third parties commissioned by the respective Land or municipality or at GPs’ surgeries. The Federal Government will cover the costs from 8 March onwards.

Travelers from the UK are still required to present proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival.

Other transport sector workers must undergo a rapid antigen test no more than 24 hours prior to departure. Additionally, all travelers must fill out a declaration form prior to entry and self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period.

Visits to care homes are allowed as long as this does not hamper efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Residents at the end of their life or in a critical condition are always allowed to have visitors. Care homes will assess the situation and decide when residents can receive more visitors. Guidelines have been drawn up for this purpose.   In the event of an outbreak in a care home, all residents and staff will be tested weekly.  It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart. Make clear arrangements and check before the visit whether anyone has symptoms. If a visitor or a person they want to visit has cold-like symptoms, a fever or shortness of breath, the visit should be postponed.

Sweden,SWE,2021-02-27,H6: Facial Coverings,"Several regions have introduced more extensive mask recommendations: the use of masks on public transport at all times, not only during rush hours, and when there is prolonged (15+ min) close contact with other people indoors.

But those who normally work but because of the covid-19, the firms cannot pay them, for those people there is two options.     First is Cash payment support which is given to workers who are currently in unpaid time-off (due to covid-19, firms cannot fire the employers, so they are sending their workers to unpaid time-off). In one month its max pay time is 30 days and the daily wage is 47.70 TRY (The currency is changing rapidly in these weeks, so to avoid the wrong amount, I didn't write in USD form).  This support is ending on 05/17/2021 if there won't be any extension.    The second way is a short-time working allowance/work. In this payment, the workers who are currently working (who are not in time-off or any other absence situation) and be approved by the Turkish Employment Agency are getting %60 of their daily gross earnings.
