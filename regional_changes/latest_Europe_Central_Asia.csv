Therefore, the "" 5-point plan for the return to normality at universities and colleges"" , which the BMBWF presented at the start of the 2022 summer semester, also provides for more studying on site in the lecture halls, seminar rooms, laboratories and offices , teaching, researching and working. From an epidemiological point of view, the prerequisites for this are basically in place - not least due to the pleasingly high vaccination rate of students and all university and university members, due to the lower hospital utilization and due to the extensive experience in corona management of the university and university management over the past two years .    ""Despite this priority of presence, corona measures, in particular access regulations at universities and colleges, can still apply. As before, the basis for this is the 2nd COVID-19 Higher Education Act , the validity of which was extended for the summer semester 2022. After all, the pandemic is not over yet. In the summer semester 2022, after a corresponding analysis of the individual framework conditions, the respective university and university management will determine which corona measures these are. They know best about the respective circumstances and requirements.""    Sources:  https://archive.ph/q7myw [current measures]  https://archive.ph/irzVw  https://archive.ph/wDoGl"

"7","Austria","AUT",2022-07-18,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who:needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. Five free PCR and five free antigen tests are available to every citizen per month :  Five PCR tests  Five antigen tests  For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.    At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.    The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.

The FFP2 mask requirement does not apply:  â¢	during the consumption of food and drinks,  â¢	for deaf and hard of hearing people and their communication partners during communication,  â¢	if this is necessary for therapeutic-pedagogical reasons,  â¢	during the logopedic service,  â¢	if this is necessary to provide a service or if this makes it impossible to provide a service  â¢	during exercise and  â¢	in damp rooms such as showers and swimming pools.  â¢	Children up to the age of 6 do not have to wear an FFP2 mask or an MNS.

In this case, another tight-fitting mechanical protective device covering the mouth and nose area may also be worn. If the person cannot be expected to do this either for health reasons, another mechanical protective device that is not tight-fitting but completely covers the mouth and nose area may be worn. Full coverage is when the non-snug fitting guard extends to the ears and well below the chin.

If you want to continue to protect yourself, you can follow these basic principles:    Get vaccinated  Wear a face mask  Ventilate several times a day  Cough and sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your arm  Wash or sanitise your hands thoroughly  Support for those with long COVID, concerns or suffering loneliness.  In addition to the basic principles mentioned above, you can:    Keep an eye on your state of health: Monitor your state of health and get tested if you have symptoms.  Wear a mask: Respiratory masks can be a good idea in rooms or situations where there is a higher risk of transmission (e.g. enclosed and poorly-ventilated spaces, gatherings, public transport).  Keep your distance: Avoid close and protracted contact and large gatherings, and maintain a sufficient distance from others.  Work: If you work, clarify with your employer what precautionary measures apply in the workplace.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220707110344/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/so-schuetzen-wir-uns.html#accordion_21209734991657191697545  https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/so-schuetzen-wir-uns.html#accordion_21209734991657191697545"

The furloughs resulting from the volcanic eruption on La Palma, in the Canary Islands, will however continue until June and possibly beyond.    However, the conditions for this short-term extension of the pandemic furlough scheme will not be exactly the same, as 20 per cent fewer companies will benefit from the exemptions from Social Security contributions. For furloughed workers, though, nothing will change. Nearly 105,000 people are in this situation, either from the pandemic or the volcanic eruption.    There will also be a special protection mechanism for travel agencies, as this sector has been worst-hit by the pandemic and will need considerable time to recover. Nearly 10,800 workers in this industry are furloughed at present, and that is almost one in three. Next month the government will approve a scheme specifically for these workers. Companies will be able to activate this mechanism for up to one year, and can then extend it twice for six months at a time if necessary.    The CC OO union has welcomed the agreement and asked the government to also extend the Me Cuida Plan until 30 June, which it has agreed to do.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000226/https://www.surinenglish.com/spain/government-extends-furlough-20220222113506-nt.html"

If this is not possible, the safety distance of 1.5 metres should be guaranteed and a surgical mask should be worn when in contact with other people living with the patient. Be very careful with hygiene.  Contact the health service: contact the competent health authorities of the Autonomous Communities by telephone. If you feeling that the illness is serious, you have shortness of breath or chest pain, call 112.  What should I do if I had had close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 during my stay in Spain?  If you have had close contact with a COVID-19 case and you are not vaccinated with a complete vaccination regimen, you should quarantine: if you have had close contact with a patient with COVID-19 or someone suspected of having it without adequate protective measures, from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you should quarantine for 7 days staying in your home or place of accommodation, preferably in a room on your own. During the following 10 days after the last contact, protection measures should be stepped up (use of masks, limiting the number of social contacts, etc).    For more information you can consult the website of the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain, dedicated to the health emergency due to COVID-19, in different languages, on this link.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220315234253/https://www.spth.gob.es/faq?tab=2  https://web.archive.org/web/20220518025808/https://www.spth.gob.es/faq?tab=2"

Special regulations were set for school operations, which stipulated, amongst other things, the number of children in each room, the number of staff, mixing between groups, the obligation to wear a mask, proximity limits, and more. In the first wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, it was decided to teach preschool and primary school children in groups of 20 or less, alternately. This meant, for example, that in most pre-schools and primary schools, children only attended school every other day. At the same time, distance learning was almost exclusively used in colleges and universities.    As the pandemic progressed, however, it became clear that it was important to try to disrupt childrenâs daily lives as little as possible, and therefore to try to adapt to allow all children to be at school all day. This was done through the continued use of compartments, sometimes-closed canteens, limited communication during play time, mask wearing by older children and staff, a ban on parentsâ access to school premises and more.    The same rules applied to sports and leisure activities for children at any given time as were applied in schools.    Pre-school children were exempted both from the 2-metre rule and the use of masks, as they were not mature enough for anything else.      https://archive.vn/a2TzT"

Special rules were set for distance between those who were considered unrelated. Thus, the so-called two-metre rule was introduced, which was common in all services, and people were asked to respect it. Many companies and organisations, for example, put signs on the floor to help guide people about the distance needed. During periods when the number of infections decreased, the gap was shortened to one metre but then lengthened again when rules needed to be tightened.    Distance limits and the obligation to wear a mask often went hand in hand, so people were asked to keep their distance, but if this was not possible, the obligation to wear a mask applied.    https://archive.vn/a2TzT"

The public gathering restriction was first imposed on 16 March 2020, and the limit was set for gatherings with 100 people or more. As early as 22 March, the rules were further tightened and the number limit was set at 20 people. Public gathering restrictions were used throughout the pandemic, albeit intermittently, until 25 February 2022, when all restrictions were lifted in Iceland. When the rules were the strictest, only 10 people were allowed to come together, but at its most lenient, restrictions were set at 2,000 people. However, there were at times even stricter recommendations, for example in the northern Westfjords, where everything was closed and the number of people was limited to 5 people in April 2020.    Despite the general restrictions on gatherings, special rules applied to various activities such as shops and services, as the restrictions could take into account the size of the premises, whether guests sat in seats, whether they all faced the same direction, and so on. The Icelandic Sports Confederation set rules on activities during the pandemic and stipulated the number of guests as a percentage of the premisesâ operating license, for example at swimming pools and fitness centers. Various business owners soon implemented the use of compartments, for example in restaurants, so that more people could be received than would otherwise be the case, without compromising infection prevention measures.    During some time periods of the pandemic, it was decided to close all gyms, swimming pools, meeting places, and bars, in addition to which the opening hours of restaurants were severely limited depending on the status of the pandemic at any given time.  At the end of August 2021, a new rule was introduced that it was permissible to receive more people than was generally the case, or even deviate from the rules on the maximum number of people at events, provided that all guests presented a negative rapid test that was not older than 48 hours. Thus, it was expected that the particularly negative impact of COVID-19 on the performing arts and culture could be reduced.        https://archive.vn/a2TzT"
