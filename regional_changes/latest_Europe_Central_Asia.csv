Further information can be found on the website of the  Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF).""    *Universities*  Does the â3-G ruleâ - tested, recovered, vaccinated - also apply to universities and colleges?Inhalt zuklappen  In any case, it is recommended that the so-called ""3-G rule"" also authorize access to universities and colleges. As in other areas of life, those who have been tested, recovered and vaccinated should be granted access to the campus. For this, the current legal basis, the 2nd COVID-19 University Act , has been extended to the upcoming winter semester 2021/22 until February 28, 2022 and adjusted accordingly. The 3G rule is particularly relevant for participation in face-to-face courses, face-to-face exams or participation in selection, aptitude and admission procedures on site . The proven approach remains that the University and college managements are responsible for determining the specific corona measures at their locations. They know the respective conditions and requirements on site best. However, they have to guarantee the applicable level of protection, for which the current, general corona protection and hygiene measures offer a valuable basis.     Therefore, please inform yourself directly at your respective university or college how they organize their teaching and examination operations and which Corona measures they intend to take.    The 3-G rule states:     The 2nd COVID-19 Opening Ordinance defines precise criteria as to when one belongs to the group of people who have a ""low epidemiological risk"".   - Anyone who has been vaccinated with a centrally approved COVID-19 vaccine is considered vaccinated. The first vaccination counts from the 22nd day after the 1st prick for a maximum of three months from the time of vaccination. After the 2nd bite you are immunized for a total of 20 days. Vaccines for which only one vaccination is intended (e.g. from Johnson & Johnson) are valid from the 22nd day after the vaccination for a total of 270 days. This also applies to people who can be proven to have recovered as soon as they have received the first stitch.   - As tested applies to those who can provide evidence of a negative PCR test or a negative antigen test. PCR tests are valid for 72 hours from the time the sample is taken, and antigen tests for 48 hours if performed by an authorized body. Self-tests that are recorded in an official data processing system in the federal states are valid for 24 hours. In addition, there are exceptionally supervised point-of-sale tests for one-time entry of sports facilities, business premises, restaurants, hotels or an event.  - As recovered applies to those who can present a separation notice of a SARS-COV-2 infection or a medical confirmation within the last six months. Alternatively, a corresponding antibody test can be presented, which, however, must not be older than three months.  You can find more detailed information about the 3-G rule and the other applicable protective and hygiene measures on the website of the Federal Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) .

Workplaces no longer have to close. But the government has issued this guidance for workplaces: ""When to return to work, school, etc.:    Young people and adults should have a negative test result for COVID-19 before they return.    If the symptoms vanish completely after one day, they can return to work and school.    If symptoms persist, the person should stay home until their general condition is good, symptoms subside, and they have not had a fever for 24 hours without the use of fever relief medication. In most cases they should stay home for a couple of days.    If symptoms are more serious or persist, they should contact a doctor for an assessment.  If you have a negative COVID-19 test result, your symptoms are mild, and your general condition has not been affected, you do not need to stay home. Young people and adults can return to school/work when their health has improved or the same day that the test was taken if the reason for the test was mild or vague symptoms. You can return to work/school if you have residual symptoms like a runny nose or light cough.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20211001171155/https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norway-moves-to-normal-everyday-life-with-increased-emergency-preparedness/id2872539/"

Most people who become ill with Covid-19 experience mild symptoms of illness and do not need to seek medical care. But pregnant women have a slightly higher risk of becoming seriously ill. Vaccination against Covid-19 is recommended for all pregnant women, as the vaccines provide good protection against serious illness and reduce the risk of early delivery.    About pregnancy and vaccines from the Public Health Agency    Children and young people   All people, twelve years and older, are offered Covid-19 vaccination.    Each region determines how they handle consent when vaccinating minors. Some regions send a consent form in connection with the booking, others make a maturity assessment at the time of vaccination.

It is your treating doctor who will prescribe the extra dose after an individual assessment.    The Elderly  The Swedish Public Health Agency (""FolkhÃ¤lsomyndigheten"") recommends that people at increased risk of severe Covid-19 be offered a vaccine booster.
