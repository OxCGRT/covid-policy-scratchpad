Yes  If so, are test results reliably available within one calendar day? Yes  Airport Covid-19 PCR test:  Tirana International Airport offers a Covid-19 PCR test for travelers. For more information, visit their website.  Public Health Labs:  Currently, to be tested for COVID-19 by the Albanian public health authority one must have symptoms and a recommendation from the public health authorityâs family doctor.  However, private testing labs will perform a test for a fee, and no symptoms or a doctorâs recommendation is required (see details below).  If you have an Albanian social security number, you also have an assigned public health family doctor.  To learn who your public health family doctor is, call the help line at 0-800-4040 to find out.  Tests are free of charge if done by the Albanian Institute of Public Health (IPH).  Private Labs:  Individuals can also arrange private testing by going to a private testing lab. No symptoms or doctorâs order is required to arrange a private test, and no advance appointment is necessary.  According to the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are several private labs authorized to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing for administrative issues. For a full list, please see the Ministry of Health list here.  Hard copy letters of test results are provided within 24 to 72 hrs. You can arrange another method of delivery (e.g.: email or text) with the individual labs.  Stay home and contact the Albanian National Medical Emergency line at 127 if you believe that you have contracted the COVID-19 virus.  Wait for guidance before going to a medical facility.  More information can be obtained by calling the national green line at 0-800-4040 to find out.

"57","Austria","AUT",2022-04-04,"Europe_Central_Asia","C1: School closing","2T","2T","How are the current, far-reaching easing of restrictions affecting university and college operations?  Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing.

In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.

Employers should take the following measures:  Ensure that all surfaces in your workplace are clean and hygienically correct. Use alcohol-based disinfectants (minimum 70%).  Clean contact points in buildings at least three times a day, such as door handles, window handles, faucets in toilets and kitchens, cistern buttons, remote controls, power switches, door bells, elevator buttons, reception desks and more touch surfaces used by a large number of people.  Touching contaminated surfaces by employees and clients is one of the main ways the COVID-19 virus spreads.  Clean all touch surfaces at least twice a day: desktops, smartphones and other phones, laptops, keyboards, and computers according to user instructions.  Meeting rooms, trainings and other areas where a large number of people gather should be cleaned after each meeting.  Place hand sanitizers in visible places everywhere in the work environment, especially in public places where people have fewer opportunities to wash their hands regularly. Ensure that these funds are regularly updated.  For hand washing in toilets, provide warm running water and soap, as well as disposable paper towels.  Install waste bins with lids to safely dispose of used paper towels and other waste in toilets and other rooms.  Place the instructions on proper hand washing in a visible place in the toilet.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220228131602/https://covid19.fmoh.gov.ba/preporuke"
