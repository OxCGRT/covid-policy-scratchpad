Defined framework conditions also enable flexible measures to be taken at the school location.""    *Vorarlberg*  In its meeting on October 14th, 2021, the Corona Commission determined that the schools in Vorarlberg will remain in risk level 1 .    Test and mask requirement:  Schoolchildren: There is no MNS requirement in the entire school building and there is no longer any compulsory test. However, antigen tests can still be carried out voluntarily. These are confirmed by the school in the sticker pass.  Teaching and administrative staff: There is no MNS obligation in the entire school building. For staff who have not been vaccinated / have not recovered, an external PCR test must still be submitted once a week; further antigen tests must be carried out at the school. Vaccinated and convalescents can voluntarily test themselves with antigen tests.  External persons must present a 3-G certificate and wear MNS during their entire stay at the school.     Arrangement of compulsory tests and masks:  If suspected cases arise during the voluntary antigen tests or during tests outside the school, all schools have the option of ordering a temporary test or mask compulsory for individual classes or the entire school for a maximum of one week . Such an arrangement requires the approval of the Education Directorate.    *Measures for the entire federal state of Styria*  From September 30, 2021 (until July 8, 2022), additional measures will apply to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in child education and care facilities:    In order to minimize the risk of infection, the provider must implement the hygiene concepts and guidelines of the State of Styria, which include, in particular, requirements for ventilating, cleaning and disinfecting rooms as well as general hygiene measures for children, staff, external persons and accompanying persons.  Activities should be relocated to the open where this appears educationally sensible and organizationally possible.  External persons must wear an FFP2 mask in the facility.  A valid Corona test pass (documentation issued by the school on the evidence provided of a low epidemiological risk) is required to care for school-age children in after-school care centers. If no corona test pass can be presented, 3-G proof must be provided when entering the facility.    *Carinthia*  Additional measures in music schools apply to Carinthia.    Measures for the entire federal state of Carinthia  From September 13, 2021 (until February 13, 2022), additional measures will apply to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in child education and care facilities:    The 3-G rule applies when entering child education and care facilities, as well as day-care centers and when staying in closed rooms in these facilities. If this is not provided, an MNS must be worn.  The provider of a facility must implement the requirements of the COVID-19 guidelines for child education and care facilities.  Activities should be relocated to the open where this appears educationally sensible and organizationally possible.  The 3-G certificate is a prerequisite for caring for children in after-school care centers. If this cannot be achieved, the child has to wear an MNS.    *Measures for the entire federal state of Styria*  From September 30, 2021 (until July 8, 2022), additional measures will apply to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in child education and care facilities:    In order to minimize the risk of infection, the provider must implement the hygiene concepts and guidelines of the State of Styria, which include, in particular, requirements for ventilating, cleaning and disinfecting rooms as well as general hygiene measures for children, staff, external persons and accompanying persons.

Authorities have also moved France, Monaco, Portugal, Cyprus, and Iceland into the green list of countries while moving Malaysia, Eswatini, Iran, Macedonia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, the U.S., and Ireland to the orange list of countries. Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, and Singapore are to be considered red-list countries from Oct. 13.    Authorities in Bulgaria classify countries as green, orange, or red based on local disease activity and accordingly apply differing entry restrictions. Travelers from green and orange countries can enter upon presenting a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document confirming vaccination against COVID-19, recovery from COVID-19, or a recent negative test for the disease. Travelers without such documentation must isolate for 10 days on arrival, though isolation can be ended early following receipt of a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours after arrival.    Travel from red countries is permitted for EU citizens, their families, and persons traveling for selected essential purposes only. Permitted travelers from red countries must present a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document indicating vaccination against or recovery from COVID-19, in addition to a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival and certified by a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document. Limited categories of travelers are permitted to enter by only satisfying the PCR test requirement, but must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival.

Vaccination protects you and the people you live with or come in contact with. All vaccines registered in Croatia and the European Union effectively protect against severe forms of disease, hospitalization and death. On this page you can find more information about vaccinations and vaccines used in Croatia.  All citizens residing or residing in Croatia can be vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccines are not intended for children under 16 or 18 years of age, and the vaccination age depends on the type of vaccine. However, due to the higher risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19 disease, preference is given to people with chronic diseases and the elderly. These include people with respiratory, cardiovascular, malignant, kidney diseases, diabetes and immunodeficiencies.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211114003829/https://www.koronavirus.hr/o-cijepljenju/329"

On the same day, the government also introduced a ban on leaving oneâs home municipality (these are 212 small territorial areas with a median number of inhabitants of around 5,000; the smallest two municipalities have some 350 inhabitants) [32]. There were some exceptions, such as crossing over the boundaries of a municipality to visit family members in need of protection, assistance, support, or nursing care. Crossing between municipalities was also allowed for the purpose of visiting, e.g., grocery shops or pharmacies, if none existed in oneâs own municipality. The reason for moving between municipalities had to be proved with appropriate documents.    For the elderly population and those with physical disabilities, the introduced measure about visiting grocery stores was insufficient because they were unable to complete their shopping by 10 AM. Especially vulnerable were individuals whose social supporters all came from other municipalities. Therefore, representatives of different governmental and non-governmental organizations suggested extending the opening hours for vulnerable groups [33], as happened on April 4 [34], allowing them to also visit grocery stores in the last hour of opening.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247993"

For example, you may have a medical risk factor such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes or are over 35 years of age.    Most people who become ill with Covid-19 experience mild symptoms of illness and do not need to seek medical care. But pregnant women have a slightly higher risk of becoming seriously ill. Vaccination against Covid-19 is recommended for all pregnant women, as the vaccines provide good protection against serious illness and reduce the risk of early delivery.    About pregnancy and vaccines from the Public Health Agency    Children and young people   All people, twelve years and older, are offered Covid-19 vaccination.    Each region determines how they handle consent when vaccinating minors. Some regions send a consent form in connection with the booking, others make a maturity assessment at the time of vaccination.
