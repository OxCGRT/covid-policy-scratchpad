Estonia admits people with no Covid-19 symptoms arriving from the European Union, the members of the Schengen area or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as from a small number of countries outside this area - but quarantine requirements may apply.    From Monday, 19 October - in situations where the infection rate of countries is higher than 1.1x the Estonian average, or above 50, a person is allowed to come to Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania or Finland without the self-isolation obligation, if the person has taken a coronavirus test within 48 hours before arriving to Estonia, and the result of the test has been negative. At that, it must be taken into account that the person must not have travelled outside the Baltic states or Finland in the past two weeks.    At the border crossing points, i.e. ports, airports and checkpoints at Russian land borders, the travel documents and medical symptoms are checked. Border control personnel have legal rights to deny entering for persons who show symptoms of COVID-19, i.e. to deport them back to the country of arrival. A person entering Estonia from a country to which the quarantine requirements apply will have to provide the Police and Border Guard Board their address and confirm that they will remain at their place of stay for 14 days.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201023010834/https://vm.ee/en/information-countries-and-quarantine-requirements-passengers    https://web.archive.org/web/20201023004230/https://www.visitestonia.com/en/why-estonia/coronavirus-and-travelling-to-estonia"

Funding has also been allocated to enhance skills in care of older people, support public transport and increase testing and contact tracing.  To support viable businesses and reduce the number of jobs lost, measures have been adopted to reduce costs, reinforce liquidity and improve financing opportunities for businesses throughout the country. A new short-term layoff scheme and reorientation support have been introduced. Moreover, public venture capital has been strengthened to bridge the crisis for innovative businesses. Most of the measures have been of a general nature, but support targeting specific sectors – such as media, culture, sport, public transport, railways, aviation and shipping – has also been introduced.  Temporary changes have been made to unemployment insurance to increase financial security. In addition, transition opportunities have been enhanced through increased educational opportunities and improvements to student finance. Housing allowance has been raised for families with children. The Government has also increased support to non-profit organisations that support vulnerable children and women, children and LGBTI people subjected to violence, and people subjected to domestic violence, including honour-based violence and oppression.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201116044559/https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/11/additional-crisis-measures-for-businesses/     https://web.archive.org/web/20201116044918/https://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/ministry-of-finance/central-government-budget/economic-measures-in-2020-in-response-to-covid-19/"

Face masks must always be seen as complementary to other recommendations: stay at home when you have symptoms, wash your hands regularly and keep at a distance from others.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201003070614/https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/"
