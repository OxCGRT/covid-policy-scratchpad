Vaccinated visitors  Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry. If there is no evidence of a negative PCR test at the time of entry, registration must be made via the pre-travel clearance and home quarantine must be initiated immediately and until a negative test result is available.    **Entry into Austria and pre-travel clearance**  The linchpin of the COVID-19 entry regulation 2021 is the 2G+ proof : For each type of entry, proof of vaccination or recovery  with an additional negative PCR test is required. This also includes the EU Digital COVID Certificates , which are provided with an EU - compliant QR code . All vaccinations that have been approved by the EMA or the corresponding WHO process are recognized as proof of vaccination have passed successfully. Stricter rules apply when entering the country from virus variant areas and states.    Second vaccinations and each subsequent vaccination are recognized up to 270 days after administration.  There must be at least 14 days between the 1st and 2nd vaccination and at least 120 days between the 2nd and 3rd vaccination.

Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 2G+ proof (vaccinated or recovered and a negative PCR test) is required for entry.

These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay*, Vanuatu.  *Uruguay will move from the Green List to the Orange List as of February 6, 2022.  - ""Orange"" countries: countries in which there is an active circulation of the virus in controlled proportions, without diffusion of worrying variants. These are not all countries included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries.  - ""Red"" countries: countries in which active circulation of the virus is observed with the presence of variants of concern. To date, there are no countries classified as ""red"".  - ""Scarlet red"" countries: countries in which a particularly active circulation of the virus and the discovery of a variant likely to present a risk of increased transmissibility or immune escape are observed. To date, there is no country classified as ""scarlet red"".

They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    This obligation does not apply to the travel of road transport professionals in the exercise of their activity and to the following trips by land:    Journeys of less than 24 hours within a perimeter defined by a radius of 30 kilometres around the place of residence;  Business travel whose urgency or frequency is incompatible with the performance of a test or screening examination.  1.2: for Bahrain, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu:  All travellers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status, from these countries/territories must present a negative PCR test or antigen test (GAD) taken less than 48 hours before the flight for boarding. They may be tested for antigen on arrival.    2/ travellers from a country/territory classified as ""orange"": all countries/territories other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 (""green"")    - All travellers twelve years of age or older, regardless of their vaccination status, must present a negative PCR test or antigen test (GAD) taken less than 48 hours before the flight. For unvaccinated travellers from the UK, the time to complete the PCR or antigenic test is 24 hours.    All travelers will be eligible for an antigen test upon arrival. In addition:    - vaccinated travellers (full vaccination schedule) are not subject to the regime of compelling reasons.  - unvaccinated travellers are subject to the imperative grounds regime and will have to commit to a 7-day self-isolation and undergo a test at the end of this period. The list of compelling reasons is specified in the travel and travel certificate issued by the Ministry of the Interior. Under this list, the following may enter France: the French, their spouses and children, nationals of the European area as well as their spouses and children having their main residence in France or who join, in transit through France, their main residence in a country of the European area or the country of which they are nationals.    - https://web.archive.org/web/20220205235349/https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/informations-pratiques/article/coronavirus-covid-19"
