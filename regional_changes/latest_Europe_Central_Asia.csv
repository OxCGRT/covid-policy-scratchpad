Therefore, the "" 5-point plan for the return to normality at universities and colleges"" , which the BMBWF presented at the start of the 2022 summer semester, also provides for more studying on site in the lecture halls, seminar rooms, laboratories and offices , teaching, researching and working. From an epidemiological point of view, the prerequisites for this are basically in place - not least due to the pleasingly high vaccination rate of students and all university and university members, due to the lower hospital utilization and due to the extensive experience in corona management of the university and university management over the past two years .    ""Despite this priority of presence, corona measures, in particular access regulations at universities and colleges, can still apply. As before, the basis for this is the 2nd COVID-19 Higher Education Act , the validity of which was extended for the summer semester 2022. After all, the pandemic is not over yet. In the summer semester 2022, after a corresponding analysis of the individual framework conditions, the respective university and university management will determine which corona measures these are. They know best about the respective circumstances and requirements.""    Sources:  https://archive.ph/q7myw [current measures]  https://archive.ph/irzVw  https://archive.ph/wDoGl"

"7","Austria","AUT",2022-07-18,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who:needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. Five free PCR and five free antigen tests are available to every citizen per month :  Five PCR tests  Five antigen tests  For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.    At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.    The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.

The furloughs resulting from the volcanic eruption on La Palma, in the Canary Islands, will however continue until June and possibly beyond.    However, the conditions for this short-term extension of the pandemic furlough scheme will not be exactly the same, as 20 per cent fewer companies will benefit from the exemptions from Social Security contributions. For furloughed workers, though, nothing will change. Nearly 105,000 people are in this situation, either from the pandemic or the volcanic eruption.    There will also be a special protection mechanism for travel agencies, as this sector has been worst-hit by the pandemic and will need considerable time to recover. Nearly 10,800 workers in this industry are furloughed at present, and that is almost one in three. Next month the government will approve a scheme specifically for these workers. Companies will be able to activate this mechanism for up to one year, and can then extend it twice for six months at a time if necessary.    The CC OO union has welcomed the agreement and asked the government to also extend the Me Cuida Plan until 30 June, which it has agreed to do.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000226/https://www.surinenglish.com/spain/government-extends-furlough-20220222113506-nt.html"

If during your stay in Spain you develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) or other symptoms compatible with COVID-19 such as reduced sense of smell and taste, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, general weakness, diarrhea or vomiting, you must commit to:    Self-isolating: staying at home or place of accommodation and self-isolating in a room. Preferably in a room for individual use, which is well ventilated and with an individual bathroom. If this is not possible, the safety distance of 1.5 metres should be guaranteed and a surgical mask should be worn when in contact with other people living with the patient. Be very careful with hygiene.  Contact the health service: contact the competent health authorities of the Autonomous Communities by telephone. If you feeling that the illness is serious, you have shortness of breath or chest pain, call 112.  What should I do if I had had close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 during my stay in Spain?  If you have had close contact with a COVID-19 case and you are not vaccinated with a complete vaccination regimen, you should quarantine: if you have had close contact with a patient with COVID-19 or someone suspected of having it without adequate protective measures, from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you should quarantine for 7 days staying in your home or place of accommodation, preferably in a room on your own. During the following 10 days after the last contact, protection measures should be stepped up (use of masks, limiting the number of social contacts, etc).
