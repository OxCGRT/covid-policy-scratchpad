"7","Austria","AUT",2022-06-01,"Europe_Central_Asia","H2: Testing policy","3","3","Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .  At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who:needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.  Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.  1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The individual federal states are responsible for the exact implementation, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.  1.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for accompanying persons and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.    1.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. Five free PCR and five free antigen tests are available to every citizen per month :  o	Five PCR tests  o	Five antigen tests  For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.  At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.  The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.    Sources:  https://archive.ph/Rol1W [Novelle zur 2.

In order to counteract this burden, there is a change in the procedure for isolating contact persons . They are now subject to a traffic restriction for 10 days.  No contact persons are:  â¢	Persons if FFP 2 masks were worn on both sides during contact,  â¢	Persons with 3 immunological events ( e.g. 3 vaccinations),  â¢	Children up to 12 years of age with 2 immunological events, or  â¢	People who have recovered within the last 3 months (omicron recoveries).     Traffic Restriction:  â¢	Wearing an  FFP 2 mask  or a higher-quality mask when in contact with other people, even within private living areas,  â¢	No visits to facilities with vulnerable people or risky settings ( e.g. retirement homes, health facilities),  â¢	No entry into facilities  or no exercise of activities where  an FFP 2 mask  or an MNS is not worn  continuously  (catering establishments, fitness clubs , etc. ),  â¢	No attendance of major events and the like (sporting events, concerts, etc.)  Visiting the place of work is generally possible, provided that the continuous wearing of an  FFP 2 mask and compliance with suitable protective measures can be guaranteed.

FFP2 mask requirement  An FFP2 mask or a mask with at least an equivalent standardized standard must continue to be worn in the following vulnerable settings:  â¢	retirement and nursing homes,  â¢	Hospitals and health resorts and other places where health and care services are provided.    The FFP2 mask requirement does not apply:  â¢	during the consumption of food and drinks,  â¢	for deaf and hard of hearing people and their communication partners during communication,  â¢	if this is necessary for therapeutic-pedagogical reasons,  â¢	during the logopedic service,  â¢	if this is necessary to provide a service or if this makes it impossible to provide a service  â¢	during exercise and  â¢	in damp rooms such as showers and swimming pools.  â¢	Children up to the age of 6 do not have to wear an FFP2 mask or an MNS. Children from the age of 6 to 14 may wear an MNS or a tight-fitting mechanical protective device.  â¢	Pregnant women may also wear an MNS or a tight-fitting mechanical protective device (medical confirmation must be presented in certain cases).  â¢	For people who cannot be expected to do this for health or disability reasons. In this case, another tight-fitting mechanical protective device covering the mouth and nose area may also be worn. If the person cannot be expected to do this either for health reasons, another mechanical protective device that is not tight-fitting but completely covers the mouth and nose area may be worn. Full coverage is when the non-snug fitting guard extends to the ears and well below the chin.

This royal decree establishes the areas where the mask will continue to be mandatory. However, it is recommended for all people with a greater vulnerability to COVID-19 infection to maintain the use of a mask in any situation in which there is prolonged contact with people at a distance of less than 1.5 meters.    For this reason, responsible use of the mask is recommended in closed spaces for public use in which people transit or spend a long time. Likewise, the responsible use of the mask in crowded events is recommended. In the family environment and in private gatherings or celebrations, responsible use is recommended based on the vulnerability of the participants.    In the work environment, in general, the use of masks will not be mandatory. However, those responsible for occupational risk prevention, in accordance with the corresponding risk assessment of the job, may determine the appropriate preventive measures that must be implemented in the workplace or in certain areas of the work centers, including the possible use of masks, if this is derived from the aforementioned evaluation.    Consequently, the mandatory use of a mask is maintained, first of all, in health centers, services and establishments, since these are areas where there may be a greater concentration of vulnerable people in whom the risk of serious illness is greater and, on the other hand, where the probability of transmission is higher, since they are places where there may be a greater number of people with communicable respiratory infections, in addition to COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220503180420/https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2022-6449"

The furloughs resulting from the volcanic eruption on La Palma, in the Canary Islands, will however continue until June and possibly beyond.    However, the conditions for this short-term extension of the pandemic furlough scheme will not be exactly the same, as 20 per cent fewer companies will benefit from the exemptions from Social Security contributions. For furloughed workers, though, nothing will change. Nearly 105,000 people are in this situation, either from the pandemic or the volcanic eruption.    There will also be a special protection mechanism for travel agencies, as this sector has been worst-hit by the pandemic and will need considerable time to recover. Nearly 10,800 workers in this industry are furloughed at present, and that is almost one in three. Next month the government will approve a scheme specifically for these workers. Companies will be able to activate this mechanism for up to one year, and can then extend it twice for six months at a time if necessary.    The CC OO union has welcomed the agreement and asked the government to also extend the Me Cuida Plan until 30 June, which it has agreed to do.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000226/https://www.surinenglish.com/spain/government-extends-furlough-20220222113506-nt.html"

If during your stay in Spain you develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) or other symptoms compatible with COVID-19 such as reduced sense of smell and taste, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, general weakness, diarrhea or vomiting, you must commit to:    Self-isolating: staying at home or place of accommodation and self-isolating in a room. Preferably in a room for individual use, which is well ventilated and with an individual bathroom. If this is not possible, the safety distance of 1.5 metres should be guaranteed and a surgical mask should be worn when in contact with other people living with the patient. Be very careful with hygiene.  Contact the health service: contact the competent health authorities of the Autonomous Communities by telephone. If you feeling that the illness is serious, you have shortness of breath or chest pain, call 112.  What should I do if I had had close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 during my stay in Spain?  If you have had close contact with a COVID-19 case and you are not vaccinated with a complete vaccination regimen, you should quarantine: if you have had close contact with a patient with COVID-19 or someone suspected of having it without adequate protective measures, from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you should quarantine for 7 days staying in your home or place of accommodation, preferably in a room on your own.
