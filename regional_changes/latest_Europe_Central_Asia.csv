Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.    Therefore, please find out from your respective university or college which corona measures must be observed at their locations.

No.    Are there restrictions on intercity or interstate travel?  Yes, in some cases.  As of May 11, 2021, the Government of Kazakhstan began prohibiting people who accompany departing travelers or meet arriving passengers from entering airports and rail stations in regions in high risk âRed Zones.â An exception exists for airports and rail stations participating in the âAshyqâ application system (please see further information on âAshyqâ in the Quarantine Information paragraph below).  Kazakhstanâs regions are empowered to take additional measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 as necessary, including erecting checkpoints to limit travel in and out of cities and oblasts.  Before pursuing domestic travel in Kazakhstan, we urge you to research whether checkpoints might be in place that could restrict your ability to travel.

Your doctor will decide to refer you for a coronavirus test based on an assessment of your health, including symptoms that may indicate COVID-19. .  If a GP decides to test a patient with disturbing symptoms, it will be a rapid antigen test. The test result is known after a few or several minutes. The test will be free for the patient.  A PCR test may be ordered by your doctor prior to admission to hospital if deemed necessary. The PCR test will be used in the event of definitive confirmation or exclusion of whether the symptoms of respiratory tract infections with which the patient entered the hospital are caused by the coronavirus.  In the case of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, the doctor recommends self-isolation (sick leave) until symptoms disappear. Just like any infectious disease, such as the flu.  The length of the sick leave depends on the doctor (minimum 7 days recommended), depending on the patient's condition, risk factors for the severe course of the COVID-19 disease (e.g. lack of vaccination against COVID-19, advanced age, chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes) and high risk the occurrence of complications.    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/zapisz-sie-na-test-na-koronawirusa"

Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220411094017/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/coronavirus    Which vaccines are available in TAJIKISTAN?    The U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe is aware that Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines are available at Prospekt Medical Clinic (48-702-44-00), subject to availability.  Please contact the clinic directly for information about cost and availability.  The quality of Tajikistanâs medical infrastructure is significantly below Western standards, with shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics.  Due to extremely limited vaccine availability, we strongly recommend that travelers complete their COVID-19 vaccination before traveling to Tajikistan.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220409143707/https://tj.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
