To achieve this, antigenic tests will be generalized in the short term, in addition to RT-PCRs, which remain the reference. More than 5 million tests have already been ordered and are made available to health establishments and ARS. These tests are CE marked and meet, according to the manufacturer's declarations, the minimum technical specifications provided by the High Authority for Health (sensitivity> 80%, specificity> 99%), which issued two opinions on the subject, the September 25 and October 9.https://covid-19.sante.gouv.fr/tests ).  Several screening campaigns have been initiated in universities, in particular for health students. This is for example the case in Ile-de-France with campaigns at the Faculty of Medicine of Sorbonne, Necker or even in a Nursing Training Institute in Paris. Other campaigns are being carried out in nursing homes to ensure screening of asymptomatic staff, particularly in the Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Ile-de-France regions. These campaigns are in progress and an assessment could be drawn up later. The ministry wanted to broaden the experiments and deployment channels across the country very quickly.  In addition, liberal health professionals (pharmacists, nurses and doctors) are now authorized to carry out these rapid antigenic tests, ensuring a large-scale deployment and closer to the population.  https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19"

Private laboratories also offer testing, but this is not free.     The Luxembourg government is embarking on a new phase of screening with the aim to test representative samples of the population in order to monitor developments and to be as flexible as possible in the event of an increase in the number of cases. This is the best way to break infection chains and effectively trace the contacts of infected people.    The COVID-19 test at the invitation of the Luxembourg Government concerns residents and cross-border workers. It is free of charge.    The Large Scale Testing strategy divides people into representative groups, e.g. according to business sector, age and place of residence. This means that members of the same household, residents of a residential area or a circle of colleagues receive invitations deliberately staggered by several weeks according to the targeted samples. This also makes it possible to maintain continuous testing. It is therefore a strategy based on a large scale sampling approach. This organised exercise makes it possible to control and keep the rate of infections at a very low level and thus ensure the protection of everyone. The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and protects us all.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213106/https://covid19.public.lu/en/testing.html"

When arriving from countries with a 14-day cumulative number of COVID-19 cases that is higher than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, self-isolation must be observed for 10 days.  10-day self-isolation must be observed when entering Latvia from the countries listed in the “National COVID-19 morbidity rates” section of the SPKC website.  If a person is arriving from a “safe” country by transiting through an “unsafe country”, the person must observe self-isolation; in order to avoid self-isolation, a different return route must be chosen.  Self-isolation means staying in the place of self-isolation without exposing other persons to the risk of infection and without making direct contact with others (not receiving guests, not visiting anyone, not going to work or public places where many people may be present, except for going to the shop or getting to the place of residence or of self-isolation immediately after arriving in Latvia, using a mouth and nose covering).  https://web.archive.org/web/20201207042737/https://covid19.gov.lv/en/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers"
