Short-time work supports companies in order to keep as many employees as possible in the company, even in times of financial crisis. The employment service (AMS) takes over the majority of the salary payments.     Short-time working cannot be requested by individual employees; this decision can only be made by the company itself. In general, support can only be given to companies that have been severely affected by the current corona crisis and have thus got into a critical financial situation.    80-90% of the salary will be covered during short-time work.    The Corona short-time work is currently limited to a duration of 3 months. This time frame can later be extended by a further 3 months.    In principle, all employees subject to unemployment insurance are eligible for short-time work, provided they have a fully paid calendar month before starting short-time work.    Members of the executive body are eligible if they are ASVG-insured; also board members who are subject to the ASVG.    Apprentices are eligible.

The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Contact persons are defined as persons with defined contact to a confirmed case during the time period of infectivity (48 hours before the onset of the disease, up to 10 days after the onset of the disease).    Contact tracers notify persons which shared the same environment as the confirmed case. Depending on how long and intensive the contact was with this person, one is identified as contact person K1 or K2. Further instructions are then given depending upon this classification.    “Stop Corona” app is Austria’s official contact tracing app which automatically records any and all contacts while adhering to strict data protection guidelines. As soon as a user reports an infection, all contacts are automatically notified. Use of the app is optional.     https://web.archive.org/web/20201220043053/https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Coronavirus---Haeufig-gestellte-Fragen/FAQ--Testungen-und-Quarantaene.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220044213/https://www.austria.info/en/service-and-facts/coronavirus-information/app"

When meeting in closed public spaces, a distance of one meter must be kept and mouth and nose protection must be worn.    It is not compulsory to wear mouth and nose protection outdoors, with the exception of the events listed in Section 12 of the ordinance (e.g. demonstrations, funerals). Regarding this, there may be regional rules of their own.    In the workplace, mouth and nose protection must be worn in closed rooms if physical contact with other people cannot be ruled out and the risk of infection cannot be minimized by other suitable protective measures (e.g. by means of a technical protective device such as partition or plexiglass walls).     If technical protective measures make it impossible to carry out the work (e.g. for actors), organizational protective measures (such as the formation of permanent teams) must be provided instead.    Employees and employers can mutually agree on stricter regulations regarding the wearing of mouth and nose protection.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201219044559/https://corona-ampel.gv.at/aktuelle-massnahmen/bundesweite-massnahmen/"

The federal government and other government representatives have repeatedly emphasized that there will be no general compulsory vaccination.    The first effective, safe and effective vaccines in relevant quantities could be available in Austria from the beginning of 2021. The crucial point is the central European approval for the European Union. Only then will the vaccines meet the statutory quality requirements.    Because not enough vaccines will be initially available to vaccinate everyone at the same time, the people who are at the highest risk will be vaccinated at the beginning.

In December, it covers independents in the hospitality, events, entertainment, culture, fairs, markets, travel, hairdressing and beauty sectors. The double “droit de passerelle” (transitional allowance) as the mechanism is called, grants independents without family responsibilities 2,583.40 euros per month in Covid-19 support, while those with families are eligible for 3,228.20 euros. The mechanism, which initially covered October and November, was first extended to December, and now covers the month of January, pending the implementation of a new system next year.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215140729/https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/145101/belgium-doubles-financial-allowance-for-independents-affected-by-covid-19-measures/"

Angelov emphasized that the vaccination plan specifies the phases that determine which groups of the population and in what order will be immunized against the new virus - medical teams, social and pedagogical staff, the elderly over 65 years, patients with chronic diseases.""    Parliament has backed the government plan to take part in an EU scheme and get vaccine shots from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sanofi.    Vaccines will be administered only with the permission of the European regulator. To ensure that sufficient quantities of COVID-19 vaccines are provided in the country as soon as possible, they will be delivered centrally through a joint EU public procurement mechanism.

More than 5 million tests have already been ordered and are made available to health establishments and ARS. These tests are CE marked and meet, according to the manufacturer's declarations, the minimum technical specifications provided by the High Authority for Health (sensitivity> 80%, specificity> 99%), which issued two opinions on the subject, the September 25 and October 9.https://covid-19.sante.gouv.fr/tests ).  Several screening campaigns have been initiated in universities, in particular for health students. This is for example the case in Ile-de-France with campaigns at the Faculty of Medicine of Sorbonne, Necker or even in a Nursing Training Institute in Paris. Other campaigns are being carried out in nursing homes to ensure screening of asymptomatic staff, particularly in the Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Ile-de-France regions. These campaigns are in progress and an assessment could be drawn up later. The ministry wanted to broaden the experiments and deployment channels across the country very quickly.  In addition, liberal health professionals (pharmacists, nurses and doctors) are now authorized to carry out these rapid antigenic tests, ensuring a large-scale deployment and closer to the population.  https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19"
