The National Vaccination Board (NIG) reacted to the threatened rapid spread of the Omikron variant of the coronavirus and updated its recommendations on Thursday evening. In addition to the general recommendation to increase the vaccination rate with the third bite as quickly as possible, it is also about the fourth vaccination. The NIG does not generally recommend this, but it should be offered in the high-risk and system-critical area from six months after the third stitch.    That would affect the particularly exposed health workers. The prerequisite is that the person concerned expressly requests this and a doctor has made an individual assessment; it is an off-label vaccination.

These exceptions are contingent on the 1.5 metre social distancing rules being maintained.    The face mask can also be removed outdoors in Spain by those travelling by boat, an exception that was included in the previous law. However, the new rules make masks mandatory below deck, even if social distancing is maintained.

Countries of the travellers origin are categorised as follows:     ""Green"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which no active circulation of the virus is observed and no variants of concern are identified. These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, South Korea, The United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu.    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions. These are all countries/territories not included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries/territories. Reinforced measures are in force for travel between France and the United Kingdom. The Travel Advice sheet for the United Kingdom should be consulted.    ""Red"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus with the presence of variants of concern is observed. These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Moldova, Montenegro, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe.    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom:     - subject to the list of ""compelling reasons""  - must present a negative PCR or antigenic (TAG) test taken less than 24 hours before the flight on boarding ;  - must register before departure on the eOS-COVID digital platform  ;  - may be tested antigen on arrival ;  - will be subject to mandatory isolation for 10 days,supervised and controlled by the security forces. This isolation obligation may be lifted from 48 hours, subject to being able to justify a negative test (PCR or TAG).    Specific guidance for UK passengers is available at https://web.archive.org/web/20220108054040/https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/conseils-par-pays-destination/royaume-uni/    Passengers from Green List countries are divided into two groups:     1. Member States of the European Union, Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Holy See and Switzerland - Travelers twelve years of age or older who do not have proof of a complete vaccination schedule or a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 must present before travel the negative result of a test (PCR or antigenic) of less than 24 hours.

There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.    As before, day zero is the day an individual takes a PCR test, which is positive. Neither a positive at-home test nor a rapid antigen test can be used as a benchmark for day zero.    As previously stated, the amended rules came into force yesterday, regarding quarantine for those who have received a booster dose and are exposed to COVID-19. For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.  We must continue to look after vulnerable groups in society and pursue individual infection control measures as never before.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110112145/https://www.covid.is/announcements"

Information on centres for COVID-19 PCR or rapid antigen tests  PCR-test - Symptom testing:  If you have symptoms or suspect you have an infection, you should be tested even if you have been vaccinated.  Stay at home and register immediately for testing on My Page at Heilsuvera. If you do not have an electronic ID, you can contact, by telephone, your local healthcare centre, LÃ¦knavaktin 1700 (the on-call medical hotline) or the Heilsuvera online chat. If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or LÃ¦knavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.  Symptom testing is always free of charge, for tourists as well.  Rapid antigen test - testing for asymptomatic people  Rapid antigen tests are used to screen for COVID-19 virus with asymptomatic people. If you suspect you have an infection, you should have a PCR-test.  Self-tests  Self-tests are not deemed reliable.

A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted.

In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206184014/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi"

From this date, nonresident foreign nationals from the following countries are prohibited from entry: South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar, eSwatini, Malawi, Tanzania, and Hong Kong. Additionally, travelers from countries that have declared the presence of the Omicron variant must - regardless of vaccination status - present a negative PCR test and self-isolate for seven days on arrival; these countries currently include Australia, Belgium, the UK, Czech Republic, Germany, Egypt, Israel, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands.    Other international entry restrictions remain in effect. Visa-free travel remains suspended. However, flights with several countries have resumed, including Belarus, Egypt, Germany, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, the UAE, and Uzbekistan, though capacity is likely to be limited. Some routes may also be suspended in the wake of the new entry restrictions.    As of Nov. 30, all international arrivals must provide a vaccination certificate or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before entry into Kazakhstan.   https://web.archive.org/web/20220102065005/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/551076/kazakhstan-authorities-announce-tightening-of-international-entry-restrictions-due-to-omicron-covid-19-variant-from-dec-3-update-50"
