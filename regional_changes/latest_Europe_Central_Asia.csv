The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

"265","Bulgaria","BGR",2020-12-04,"Europe_Central_Asia","H7: Vaccination policy","0",NA,"On 4 December, the National Plan for Vaccination against COVID-19 was adopted. No deliveries yet received so coded as 0    The vaccine for Bulgarian citizens will be completely free and voluntary, according to the Prime Minister.     There are two conditions for immunization - expressed desire and informed consent.    ""We are fulfilling our commitment and adopting the National Plan on time. The country is ready and logistically to meet the first delivery of vaccines and, without wasting any time, to start immunization, which will be completely free and voluntary,"" said Borissov.    The Minister of Health reports that the necessary freezers for storing the vaccines are already available, as well as specialized transport for their delivery in the country. Angelov emphasized that the vaccination plan specifies the phases that determine which groups of the population and in what order will be immunized against the new virus - medical teams, social and pedagogical staff, the elderly over 65 years, patients with chronic diseases.""    Parliament has backed the government plan to take part in an EU scheme and get vaccine shots from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sanofi.    Vaccines will be administered only with the permission of the European regulator. To ensure that sufficient quantities of COVID-19 vaccines are provided in the country as soon as possible, they will be delivered centrally through a joint EU public procurement mechanism.    The government expects to receive 12-13 million doses at a total cost of about EUR 250 million (USD 304 million).    https://web.archive.org/web/20201214235545/https://coronavirus.bg/bg/news/938    https://web.archive.org/web/20201214235756/https://coronavirus.bg/bg/news/939    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215015622if_/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bulgaria-vaccines/bulgaria-prepares-for-covid-19-vaccines-as-death-rates-spike-idUSKBN28E0Z3"

To achieve this, antigenic tests will be generalized in the short term, in addition to RT-PCRs, which remain the reference. More than 5 million tests have already been ordered and are made available to health establishments and ARS. These tests are CE marked and meet, according to the manufacturer's declarations, the minimum technical specifications provided by the High Authority for Health (sensitivity> 80%, specificity> 99%), which issued two opinions on the subject, the September 25 and October 9.https://covid-19.sante.gouv.fr/tests ).  Several screening campaigns have been initiated in universities, in particular for health students. This is for example the case in Ile-de-France with campaigns at the Faculty of Medicine of Sorbonne, Necker or even in a Nursing Training Institute in Paris. Other campaigns are being carried out in nursing homes to ensure screening of asymptomatic staff, particularly in the Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Ile-de-France regions. These campaigns are in progress and an assessment could be drawn up later. The ministry wanted to broaden the experiments and deployment channels across the country very quickly.  In addition, liberal health professionals (pharmacists, nurses and doctors) are now authorized to carry out these rapid antigenic tests, ensuring a large-scale deployment and closer to the population.  https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19"

Private laboratories also offer testing, but this is not free.     The Luxembourg government is embarking on a new phase of screening with the aim to test representative samples of the population in order to monitor developments and to be as flexible as possible in the event of an increase in the number of cases. This is the best way to break infection chains and effectively trace the contacts of infected people.    The COVID-19 test at the invitation of the Luxembourg Government concerns residents and cross-border workers. It is free of charge.    The Large Scale Testing strategy divides people into representative groups, e.g. according to business sector, age and place of residence. This means that members of the same household, residents of a residential area or a circle of colleagues receive invitations deliberately staggered by several weeks according to the targeted samples. This also makes it possible to maintain continuous testing. It is therefore a strategy based on a large scale sampling approach. This organised exercise makes it possible to control and keep the rate of infections at a very low level and thus ensure the protection of everyone. The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and protects us all.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213106/https://covid19.public.lu/en/testing.html"
