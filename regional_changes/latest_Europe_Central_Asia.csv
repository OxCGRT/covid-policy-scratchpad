"26","Albania","ALB",2022-02-22,"Europe_Central_Asia","E1: Income support","1G","1G","The government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable which were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 98 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.    The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.    In September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employersâ share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.    /web/20220301071254/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Precautionary measures: requirements  Special provisions for restaurants, bars and canteens  Special provisions for events  Protecting workers: requirements  Precautionary measures: requirements  All publicly accessible establishments and businesses that are permitted to open, as well as events, require a precautionary measures plan.    In order to prevent the coronavirus from spreading again, it is still important to keep an appropriate distance, wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, and to wear a mask and erect partitions where necessary.      The same requirements apply to all these sectors of the economy. The requirements are regulated by the COVID-19 Special Situation Ordinance (Art. 10 and Annex). There are no longer any model precautionary measures plans. However, business sectors and associations may still refer to them as an aid. Businesses are still required to produce and put in place a precautionary measures plan. Information on precautionary measures can also be found on the SECO website (in German, French or Italian).    The following applies in all situations: People showing symptoms of illness should stay at home and get tested.    The precautionary measures must be drawn up to take into account the following requirements:    1.     They must provide for measures governing hygiene (e.g. possibility of washing or disinfecting hands, regular cleaning of surfaces) and ventilation.    2.     They must additionally ensure that the requirements for the mandatory wearing of masks can be met (particularly in publicly accessible indoor areas of establishments and businesses).    3.     Measures relating to maintaining distance, unless access for people over age 16 is restricted to those with a certificate. The precautionary measures must make it possible for people to observe the necessary distance while entering the establishment, business or event too. This does not apply for access to public vehicles.    4.     A person must be named who is responsible for the implementation of the precautionary measures and who is the contact person for the cantonal authorities.    Precautionary measures for publicly accessible facilities and businesses, including educational establishments, and the organisers of events with a COVID certificate requirement must also include measures to implement restrictions on access (e.g. performing access controls or informing visitors of the need for a certificate).    Specific information on the requirements for precautionary measures can be found in Annex 1 to the COVID-19 Special Situation Ordinance.    The establishments, businesses and organisers themselves are primarily responsible for implementing these precautionary measures. Neither the federal government nor the cantons approve precautionary measures plans; the precautionary measures are only checked as part of the approval process for large-scale events. The cantons are responsible for monitoring compliance and for conducting inspections.    The requirements with regard to precautionary measures may change depending on the situation. Be sure to check regularly that your precautionary measures meet the latest requirements.    https://archive.fo/EiouI  https://archive.fo/rjt1j"

Youâll find more detailed information on the Masks page.    Wearing of masks compulsory throughout Switzerland  The mask-wearing requirement applies throughout Switzerland on public transport and in hospitals, clinics, retirement and care homes. Besides the nationwide rules, the cantons can make wearing masks compulsory in additional areas and situations. For this reason you must always follow the cantonal rules.   Wearing of masks compulsory on public transport and on planes  You must wear a mask in enclosed areas of the following public transport services and facilities:  Trains, trams and buses  Mountain railways, cable cars and chair lifts  Ships and boats  Aircraft (all scheduled and chartered flights taking off or landing in Switzerland)  Note: Masks are compulsory at all times, no matter how many people are travelling. If you refuse to wear a mask on public transport, you may be asked by the transport staff to get off at the next stop. If you refuse to do so, you may receive a fine. You may remove your mask briefly to eat or drink on public transport.     Wearing of masks compulsory in publicly accessible areas  To protect particularly vulnerable people, in certain situations masks must be worn in publicly accessible indoor areas of hospital, clinics, retirement and care homes.   Wearing of masks compulsory at work  Your employer has a duty to protect you. For this reason you should find out from your employer what requirements apply in terms of mask-wearing. You will find more information on the SECO website (in German).  Exemptions from the requirement to wear a mask  Children under the age of 12 do not have to wear a mask (cantonal exemptions may apply). Masks are available in childrenâs sizes. Adult masks can also be folded and the straps shortened to fit childrenâs faces (recommended for surgical masks).  General exemptions from the requirement to wear a mask on public transport and in hospitals, clinics, retirement and care homes. In the following cases, you do not have to wear a mask (regardless of your age):  You can prove that you are unable to wear a mask for a specific reason. Such reasons include, for example, facial injuries, shortness of breath, conditions such as dementia and Alzheimerâs, anxiety when wearing a mask and disabilities that make wearing a mask intolerable or impossible. All medical grounds must be substantiated with a certificate from a doctor or psychotherapist. You will find detailed information in the factsheet from the FBED and FOPH on mask dispensing for certain people with disabilities in the Documents tab.  You are a patient in a hospital or clinic: You can take off your mask when you are in your room(s).  You are resident in a retirement or care home.  Masks in everyday life  In any situation in which you want to give yourself and others additional protection you can decide for yourself whether you want to wear a mask even if doing so is not compulsory. Itâs still recommended to wear a mask particularly in enclosed and poorly ventilated spaces.    https://archive.fo/yREMb"

The National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) recommends the following for persons who are at a higher risk:  -Get re-vaccinated  -Follow the recommendations from the Office of the Medical Director of Health and ask others to be mindful  -Avoid large events and gatherings of people where you canât keep a distance to other people  -Consider using a face mask in public spaces where you canât keep a distance to other people  -Consider talking with your workplace about how to ensure that you can go to work safely    The older you are â the more and more serious chronic diseases have â the more attention you need to pay to following the recommendations. You must naturally take your quality of life into consideration, when you place limits on your life.  *Risk groups and highly vulnerable people  https://web.archive.org/web/20220215030314/https://corona.nun.gl/en/information-about-covid-19/"

"1133","Iceland","ISL",2022-02-01,"Europe_Central_Asia","C8: International travel controls","2","2","21/2/22    People that have been infected with COVID-19 or have been vaccinated  Travel restrictions do not apply to foreign citizens who can provide appropriate proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a prior COVID-19 infection that fulfills requirements set forth by the Chief Epidemiologist    Rules at the border are in force until February 28th 2022.    Rules at the border for people with vaccination or former COVID-19 infection  All travellers must pre-register before arriving in Iceland and confirm their departure day, if available.  Present a certficate of full vaccination, or a certificate of previous infection, at the border.  If a certificate is not valid the individual needs to undergo 2 tests and quarantine for 5 days in between.  NOTE. From 1 February 2022, a vaccination certificate is valid if no more than 270 days (9 months) have elapsed from the primary vaccination when an individual has not undergone a booster vaccination. Primary vaccination is considered complete after two doses of vaccine or after one Janssen injection. A booster dose cancels this expiration date.  Those who live in Iceland, or who have a network here, must go for COVID-19 testing within 48 hours of arriving in Iceland. They do not have to present a negative COVID-19 test at the border. Testing can be obtained at the border in KeflavÃ­k or at the health care centres all over Iceland. There is no need to quarantine while waiting for the results of this test, but travellers are asked to attend to personal infection control, limit contact with vulnerable individuals and be alert to the symptoms of COVID-19.  Rules for travellers without a network in Iceland: Vaccinated passengers, and those with prior infection of COVID-19, need to present a negative covid-19 test either a PCR or Rapid antigen test. NB. self-tests are not accepted. The test must have been taken within 72 hours before departure on the first leg of the journey. A fine for not presenting a negative COVID-19 test at the border is 100.000 ISK.  If a traveller has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19, they do not need to present a negative PCR or rapid antigen test at the border. Instead, a positive PCR test must be presented that is older than 7 days (isolation completed) but younger than 180 days. These individuals do not have to take a rapid antigen test or PCR test within 48 hours due to their connection with the country.  Testing and quarantine of children: Children under the age of 18 are permitted to travel to Iceland with their parents, given the parents are exempt from travel restrictions to Iceland. However, children born in or before 2004 need to undergo testing at the border, quarantine for 5 days and then be tested a second time, unless they have a certificate of full vaccination. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt from the rules at the border.  It is recommended that travellers download the Rakning C-19 app. It is used, amongst other things, to communicate negative test results and helps to trace infections if necessary.  If the slightest suspicion arises that an individual has presented a forged certificate, he/she/they will be obliged to be tested twice with quarantine in between.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220221215242/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/vaccination-and-antibodies"
