This applies from the moment they enter the airport, station, at stops or on the platform, train or other means of transport organised by a public authority. If it is not possible to wear a face mask for medical reasons, a face shield can be worn. Public transport drivers are not required to cover their nose and mouth, insofar as the driver is well- isolated in a cabin on the one hand, and a poster and/or sticker indicates to users the reason why the driver is not wearing a mask on the other.

This ban will apply until December 22. This ban has been introduced to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, and to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.  The entry ban does not apply to citizens of EU/EEA countries, the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, or their families, or for travels to Sweden from the EU/EEA area. Furthermore, the ban does not apply if you or a close relative already live here as a permanent resident or hold a residence permit in Sweden or another EU country, or if you have a national visa to Sweden.   https://web.archive.org/web/20201109163835/https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/visiting-sweden-during-the-covid-19-pandemic"

As of 4 July, the entry ban does not apply to people who:  are an EEA citizen or a citizen of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland or the Vatican City;  have long-term resident status in Sweden or another EU Member State;  have a residence permit in Sweden or another EEA state, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland or the Vatican City;  have a national visa for Sweden or a national visa valid longer than three months in another EEA State, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland or the Vatican City;  have family ties as specified in Chapter 3a, Section 2, first paragraph, or Chapter 5, Section 3, first paragraph, points 1–4, or Section 3a of the Aliens Act (2005:716) to a person covered by any of points 1–4 or to a Swedish citizen, or  lives in one of the following countries*  Australia  Japan  New Zealand  Rwanda  Singapore  South Korea  Thailand  Uruguay  * This list of countries is continually being revised on an EU-level, and has been changed multiple times.    In addition, the entry ban does not apply to people with an essential need or function in Sweden. For example, this may be the case for:    healthcare workers, researchers in health and medical care and elderly staff;  frontier workers;  seasonal workers in the agricultural, forestry and horticulture sectors;  personnel transporting goods and other staff in the transport sector;  people covered by Chapter 2, Section 10 of the Aliens Act (2005:716);  people who work in international organisations or are invited by such organisations and whose presence is necessary for the organisations’ activities, military personnel, aid workers and civil defence staff;  passengers in transit;  people with imperative family reasons;  seafarers;  people in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons;  people who travel for the purpose of studying; and  people travelling for the purpose of performing highly skilled work, if their contribution is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed remotely, including people who will take part in or perform necessary tasks at elite sports competitions.  The above list of people who can be considered to have an essential need or function is for illustration only and there may therefore be other categories of people who may be exempted.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201122094133/https://www.government.se/articles/2020/04/faqs--entry-to-the-eu-via-sweden-banned/"

This also applies if you are a member of an unemployment insurance fund (a-kassa) and are taking part in a program through the Swedish Public Employment Office (Arbetsförmedlingen).  The lowest activity grant you can receive has been raised from 365 to 510 Swedish Krona per day.  During the first 100 days as unemployed your compensation is based on the salary you had when you were employed. You can now receive up to 1 200 Swedish Krona per day instead of 910 Swedish Krona per day if you take part in a program full time.  The temporary higher activity grants will be applicable from the April 13, 2020 to January 3, 2021.  Your activity grant is based on information that Försäkringskassan receives from your unemployment insurance fund (a-kassa). You will receive the rest of the money at the next opportunity if they sent the information after Försäkringskassan made the payment.  The government has proposed that the jobseeker´s allowance will be raised from 760 Swedish Krona to 1000 Swedish Krona from the 101 day of your unemployment. If you are a member of an unemployment insurance fund (a-kassa) and are taking part in a program through the Swedish Public Employment Office (Arbetsförmedlingen), your activity grant will be affected by this proposal.  From the 101 day of your unemployment, your activity grant will be raised from 760 to 1000 Swedish Krona if you participate full time. The temporary raise is proposed to apply from June 29, 2020 to January 3, 2021. This is still a proposal. No decision has been taken.

Examples of such situations could be a visit to the optician or when you cannot avoid using public transport even though it is crowded.
