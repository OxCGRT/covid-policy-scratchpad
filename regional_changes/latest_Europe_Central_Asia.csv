At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant.

This royal decree establishes the areas where the mask will continue to be mandatory. However, it is recommended for all people with a greater vulnerability to COVID-19 infection to maintain the use of a mask in any situation in which there is prolonged contact with people at a distance of less than 1.5 meters.    For this reason, responsible use of the mask is recommended in closed spaces for public use in which people transit or spend a long time. Likewise, the responsible use of the mask in crowded events is recommended. In the family environment and in private gatherings or celebrations, responsible use is recommended based on the vulnerability of the participants.    In the work environment, in general, the use of masks will not be mandatory. However, those responsible for occupational risk prevention, in accordance with the corresponding risk assessment of the job, may determine the appropriate preventive measures that must be implemented in the workplace or in certain areas of the work centers, including the possible use of masks, if this is derived from the aforementioned evaluation.    Consequently, the mandatory use of a mask is maintained, first of all, in health centers, services and establishments, since these are areas where there may be a greater concentration of vulnerable people in whom the risk of serious illness is greater and, on the other hand, where the probability of transmission is higher, since they are places where there may be a greater number of people with communicable respiratory infections, in addition to COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220503180420/https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2022-6449"

The furloughs resulting from the volcanic eruption on La Palma, in the Canary Islands, will however continue until June and possibly beyond.    However, the conditions for this short-term extension of the pandemic furlough scheme will not be exactly the same, as 20 per cent fewer companies will benefit from the exemptions from Social Security contributions. For furloughed workers, though, nothing will change. Nearly 105,000 people are in this situation, either from the pandemic or the volcanic eruption.    There will also be a special protection mechanism for travel agencies, as this sector has been worst-hit by the pandemic and will need considerable time to recover. Nearly 10,800 workers in this industry are furloughed at present, and that is almost one in three. Next month the government will approve a scheme specifically for these workers. Companies will be able to activate this mechanism for up to one year, and can then extend it twice for six months at a time if necessary.    The CC OO union has welcomed the agreement and asked the government to also extend the Me Cuida Plan until 30 June, which it has agreed to do.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000226/https://www.surinenglish.com/spain/government-extends-furlough-20220222113506-nt.html"

If during your stay in Spain you develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) or other symptoms compatible with COVID-19 such as reduced sense of smell and taste, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, general weakness, diarrhea or vomiting, you must commit to:    Self-isolating: staying at home or place of accommodation and self-isolating in a room. Preferably in a room for individual use, which is well ventilated and with an individual bathroom. If this is not possible, the safety distance of 1.5 metres should be guaranteed and a surgical mask should be worn when in contact with other people living with the patient. Be very careful with hygiene.  Contact the health service: contact the competent health authorities of the Autonomous Communities by telephone. If you feeling that the illness is serious, you have shortness of breath or chest pain, call 112.  What should I do if I had had close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 during my stay in Spain?  If you have had close contact with a COVID-19 case and you are not vaccinated with a complete vaccination regimen, you should quarantine: if you have had close contact with a patient with COVID-19 or someone suspected of having it without adequate protective measures, from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you should quarantine for 7 days staying in your home or place of accommodation, preferably in a room on your own. During the following 10 days after the last contact, protection measures should be stepped up (use of masks, limiting the number of social contacts, etc).

"388","Greenland","GRL",2022-05-30,"Europe_Central_Asia","H8: Protection of elderly people","1G","1G","Risk groups and highly vulnerable people  The health authorities have devised the following guideline which contains good advice and special precautions for persons in risk groups and highly vulnerable people.    People who are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19    It is always an individual assessment as to whether you are at risk of a serious illness with COVID-19 and the whole situation must be included in the assessment. However, in general, elderly people who also have several and serious chronic conditions are at a higher risk than people who only have a single mild chronic condition. There may also be social circumstances, for example, your abode situation, which overall can mean you are in a higher risk group.    People who are 80 years old or older    If you are 80 years old or older and have a chronic disease or condition, you are at an increased risk even if you are otherwise healthy and well.    People aged 65 to 79 years    Many healthy and well people in the age group 65 to 79 years, are not an increased risk, but you will be at higher risk if:    You have a chronic disease  Are mentally and physically frail  People aged less than 65 years    Only a few people who are aged 65 years old or younger are at a higher risk, but people in this age group are at a higher risk if they:    Have certain diseases  Have a chronic disease that is difficult to control  Are overweight with a BMI of 35 or greater  Are immunocompromised  Certain children and young people with chronic disease    Diseases and conditions that lead to a higher risk in adults, cannot be directly applied to children and young people. Children and young people who may be at a higher risk are typically children who also before the COVID-19 had to follow special rules, e.g. special conditions in connection with school/day care. These children are typical followed by a special clinic and thus receive individual assessment and advice.    Residents in assisted living residences and homes for the elderly    Residents in assisted living residences and homes for the elderly are at an increased risk as they are often elderly and have chronic diseases, poor functional ability and frail health.    Pregnant women    Pregnant women are considered to be at a higher risk in consideration of both the pregnant woman and the unborn child.    Good advice for people at a higher risk    In general, if you are someone who is at a higher risk, you can continue to do the things you did before the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g. go to work, participate in leisure activities and take care of your grandchildren.    If before the COVID-19 pandemic, you had to follow special precautions in your daily life to avoid being infected with an infectious disease, e.g. you have a special condition and are immunocompromised, you should continue to follow those precautions.    The National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) recommends the following for persons who are at a higher risk:    Get re-vaccinated  Follow the recommendations from the Office of the Medical Director of Health and ask others to be mindful  Avoid large events and gatherings of people where you canât keep a distance to other people  Consider using a face mask in public spaces where you canât keep a distance to other people  Consider talking with your workplace about how to ensure that you can go to work safely  The older you are â the more and more serious chronic diseases have â the more attention you need to pay to following the recommendations. You must naturally take your quality of life into consideration, when you place limits on your life.    Contact your local health service or the doctor who treats you if you are unsure of what you need to do in relation to your overall situation.    Good advice for relatives of people who are at a higher risk    As the relative of someone who is at a higher risk, it is quite natural that you can become worried.    We recommend the following for relatives of people who are at a higher risk:    Pay particular attention in complying with the general advice relating to infection prevention that is issued by the National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ). Also help your parents and other people who you live with to remember the advice â also children.  Pay careful attention for any symptoms that could be COVID-19. Immediately isolate if you develop symptoms. This also applies to mild symptoms or if you are a close contact or are infected with the coronavirus. If you are infected with the coronavirus and live with another person who is at a higher risk, you may be provided with isolation accommodation outside the home.

The citizens can apply for a free-of-charge vaccination within the statutory free-of-charge medical assistance. The Kazakhstani vaccine is called QazCovid-in. That is an inactivated vaccine, which was developed in May 2020.    Who will be vaccinated first?    During the first stages, the vaccine will be provided to people from the risk categories. If the volume of the vaccine allows, then the rest of Kazakhstani citizens will also be able to get the vaccine.    The following individuals with a high risk of contracting the coronavirus infection (priority-based order) are subject to the vaccination against the coronavirus:    medical employees, first of all employees of infectious diseases hospitals, ambulances, resuscitation and intensive care units, health care organizations providing primary health care, emergency rooms of health care organizations providing inpatient care, employees of the sanitary and epidemiological service;  teachers;  district police officers;  students;  personnel of medical and social as well as private childcare centers;  employees of Emergency Situations Service, Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal Affairs, National Security Committee, State Security Service of the Republic of Kazakhstan;  employees of Presidential Affairs Department of the Republic of Kazakhstan, civil servants, citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan working for the diplomatic and consular missions accredited in Kazakhstan, members of national teams;  people with the chronic diseases (diabetes, chronic obstructive     pulmonary and heart diseases).  Where the vaccination is performed?    Vaccination of citizens takes place in the vaccination facilities of local medical organizations.  Vaccination of specialized groups is performed at the place of service of a relevant agency.In certain cases (low population size, lack of a stationary vaccination premise, lack of refrigeration equipment with a low temperature regime), mobile vaccination facilities or mobile vaccination teams are arranged for vaccination.     A vaccination team is assembled in each vaccination facility with regard to a daily workload per 1 team, which is no more than 60 vaccines (for mobile teams no more than 40 vaccines).     Thus, 1 vaccination team consists of 1 doctor, 1 treatment nurse and 1 registrar if required.    In rural areas, a vaccination team can consist of 1 rural paramedic (if there is no doctor), 1 treatment nurse and 1 registrar if required.The vaccines that were done are registered in the established registration forms (a separate register of preventive vaccinations against COVID, a vaccination record card, a patient's medical record, a vaccination section of the medical information system) with indication of the date of vaccination, type of vaccination (component I or II), manufacturer, batch number, vaccine reaction.    It is planned that an electronic vaccination passport will be introduced.    An electronic vaccination passport is a document certifying that a person got preventive vaccines. It will provide information on medications a person received, doses, the dates and also, whether there were any reactions after a vaccination.       As soon as a person will get a vaccine against the coronavirus infection, information about it will become available in the eGov mobile app.     Who won`t be vaccinated against the coronavirus?    Vaccination against the coronavirus in Kazakhstan is contraindicated to children under 18 and people over 65 due to the lack of data on its efficiency and safety.    Individuals with permanent and temporary medical contraindications to the preventive vaccines are not subject to vaccination against COVID pursuant to the Order of Minister of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan as of October 21, 2020 No. KR DSM-146/2020 âOn Approval of the List of Medical Contraindications to Carry Preventive Vaccinationsâ.     Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment and patients with an immune deficiency may not develop a sufficient immune response. Therefore, taking drugs that suppress the function of the immune system is contraindicated for at least 1 month before and after vaccination due to the risk of decreased immunogenicity. Therefore, intake of medical products that suppress the immune system function is contraindicated for at least 1 month prior and after vaccination due to the risk of decreased immunogenicity.    Individuals suffering from an acute and symptomless COVID forms are not subject to vaccination.Individuals who had a contact with those suffering from infectious diseases, including COVID, get the vaccine after a quarantine.No screening is performed prior to vaccination to check antibodies against COVID (EIA and PCR research).  It is recommended to vaccinated those who suffered from any COVID forms in 6 months after convalescence with regard to health assessment prior to vaccination.       Can one withdraw from a vaccine?    It is possible to withdraw from the vaccine against the coronavirus. The vaccination is carried out on a voluntary basis with provision of consent by a person getting a vaccine.      Pursuant to the Article 77 of the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan ""On People's Health and Healthcare System"", Kazakhstani citizens have a right to withdraw from preventive vaccines.     https://web.archive.org/web/20220611140003/https://egov.kz/cms/en/articles/health_care/Vakcinaciya-protiv-koronavirusnoy-infekcii-?mobile=no"
