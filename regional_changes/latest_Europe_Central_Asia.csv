The overlap of the phases allows Bulgarian journalists, cameramen and photojournalists to be immunized in the third phase of the Plan.     The third phase will continue with employees of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, water supply and sewage companies employed in the transport and communications sectors, and police officers working on the first line.    Vaccination of vulnerable groups remains a top priority for the Ministry of Health. Therefore, the end of the third phase of the National Vaccination Plan will be covered by the beginning of the fourth. In this phase, those covered by immunization will be ""Elderly people over 65 years of age and those with concomitant chronic diseases, due to the more severe course of the disease and the higher risk of complications and death, including immunocompromised or persons with secondary immune deficiencies.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210209065902/https://coronavirus.bg/bg/news/1292"

ON WORK FROM HOME:   ""From Monday, 18 January, there will be a requirement to work from home"", however, a closer inspection of policy reveals that it is only mandatory that ""Employers will be required to enable all staff to work from home where it is feasible and practicable for them to do so based on the type of activity.

While the policy text seems to allow some exceptions to the work from home, other analyses of this policy refer to it as a mandatory work from home requirement for non-essential workers.    ON CODING:   For now, this policy is coded as a 2G rather than 3G since employees in certain sectors still are able to go to work or choose not to work from home even when given the option. Furthermore, the consideration of ski resorts, hair salons, etc. as 'essential' fails to meet the threshold for 3G, which requires closure of ""all-but-essential workplaces"" like grocery stores.

Target group 2: Healthcare professionals with patient contact/carers for people at especially high risk  Target group 3: Close contacts (household members or relatives providing care) of people at especially high risk  Target group 4: People in communal facilities with an increased risk of infection and outbreaks (for example homes for the handicapped).  It has become apparent that these priorities are being put into practice differently from canton to canton. In particular there are differences in the vaccination of healthcare professionals. For this reason the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) and the FOPH have drawn up guidelines specifying which groups of healthcare professionals may possibly be vaccinated at the same time as especially vulnerable people (target group 1). Given that volumes of vaccine are currently limited, the goal is to assure the provision of healthcare in areas that are particularly affected while making sufficient vaccine available for especially vulnerable people at the highest risk.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210205081724/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/impfen.html"

"1013","Ireland","IRL",2021-02-02,"Europe_Central_Asia","C8: International travel controls","3","3","Passengers arriving to Ireland from overseas are required to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. This is an online form. Paper versions of the form are also available if required.  Failure to complete the form could result in the issuing of penalties, including a fine of up to €2,500 or imprisonment for up to 6 months.  An exemption from completing the form is in place for providers of essential supply chain services such as hauliers, pilots and maritime staff.  See below for pre-departure testing requirements.  Travel within the island of Ireland is subject to prevailing domestic public health restrictions as outlined on gov.ie. Incoming passengers should ensure that they are aware of, and comply with, all relevant public health restrictions that apply to the population in general.  Passengers travelling to Northern Ireland must ensure that they are familiar with the guidance and regulations in place, including the completion of a UK Passenger Locator Form.  Travel advice for passengers whose journey originates in Great Britain, South Africa, or any country in South America  All passengers who arrive from Great Britain, South Africa or any country in South America are advised to self isolate (stay in your room) for a period of 14 days following their arrival into Ireland.  All such travellers, whether they have symptoms or not, are asked to phone any GP or GP out-of-hours service to arrange for a COVID-19 test, which should be done as soon as possible after 5 days post-arrival. This test will be free of charge if arranged through GPs.  Please check the Irish College of General Practitioners website for a list of GPs with phone contact information, or the HSE website for your local GP out of hours service.  Taking this test will allow the HSE to identify suspect cases for new variants of COVID-19 and control its transmission in Ireland. Notwithstanding the result of this test, you are advised to complete the entire 14 days period of self-isolation.  If at any point in the 14 days following arrival, a traveller develops any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, they should immediately phone a GP and alert them of their recent visit from Great Britain, South Africa or South America.  Advice on restricting movement  The EU 'traffic lights' approach to travel applies to countries in the EU/EEA.  Nearly all of Europe has a high incidence of COVID-19 and is in a high-risk category (orange/red). If you are coming from red or grey regions, or from outside the EU/EEA, you should restrict your movements for 14 days.  This applies to all people entering the State, even if you have no symptoms. If you are unsure which risk area you are travelling from, please check the ECDC website.  See above for specific requirements regarding travel from Great Britain, South Africa and South America.  Restricting your movements means staying home or in your accommodation, and avoiding contact with other people, including those in your household that are at particular risk should they contract COVID-19. You should wear a face covering, including while indoors, to protect them.  You can go outside to exercise by yourself as long as you keep 2 metres away from other people. You should not meet or socialise with people outside your immediate household.  The request to restrict your movement means:  • do not go to work, unless you work on your own and can completely avoid other people  • do not go to school or college  • do not use public transport  • do not have visitors at your home  • do not visit others, even if you usually care for them  • do not go to the shops or pharmacy unless it's absolutely necessary - where possible, order your groceries online or have some family or friends drop them off  • do not go to gatherings such as weddings or funerals - information is available on bereavement and grief during COVID-19 here.  • do not meet face-to-face with older people, anyone with a long-term medical condition or pregnant women  You can find out more about restricting your movements on the HSE website.  Categories of passengers not requested to restrict their movements on arrival  In line with the EU traffic lights approach, the request to restrict movements does not apply to travellers from green regions or orange regions or those arriving from Northern Ireland.  Currently, all passengers entering Ireland from red and grey regions within the EU/EEA and from all non-EU/EEA countries are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days. See above for specific measures applying to travel from Great Britain, South Africa and South America.  This general request to restrict movement for 14 days does not apply to certain defined categories, as indicated below:  (a) International Transport Workers, including workers in aviation, maritime and road haulage sectors  (b) Those travelling with an essential function or need as set out in paragraph 19 of the EU Council Recommendation, including:  I. Passengers travelling for the purposes of an imperative business reason, only while carrying out that essential function  II. Passengers arriving for imperative family reasons, only while pursuing that imperative reason  III. Returning passengers, who have carried out an essential function in another region, but who have otherwise restricted their movement while in that region  It is the responsibility of individuals to determine whether their circumstances fall within one of the categories outlined in the EU Council Recommendation.  You can indicate on your Passenger Locator Form if you are travelling with an essential purpose as defined by Council Recommendation 2020/1475. You may be asked for evidence in support of this.  The information provided on this form will be used to provide you with public health information and COVID-19 advice and may be used for the purpose of contact tracing.  Imperative business reasons could include clients of State agencies or those whose attendance in person is critical to the functioning of a business. It is requested that those who consider their circumstances to be within this category carry supporting documentation from the state agency concerned or from a company CEO or Chairman or Director.  Imperative family reasons could include providing essential care to children, elderly or vulnerable people (in particular to those who live alone but excluding social family visits), exercising a right of access to a child, attending a court hearing, or attending a wedding or funeral. Those who consider their circumstances to be within this category should carry supporting documentation from relevant sources such as undertakers, clerics, social workers or solicitors.  Those who intend travelling should be aware that individual workplaces, schools, childcare facilities and colleges in Ireland can apply their own health and safety measures. Intending travellers, as well as parents/guardians, should familiarise themselves with these requirements before booking any travel    http://archive.today/pH3cG  https://archive.vn/0tCnS#selection-813.13-1473.304"
