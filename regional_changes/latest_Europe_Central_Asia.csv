"26","Albania","ALB",2022-02-22,"Europe_Central_Asia","E1: Income support","1G","1G","The government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable which were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 98 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.    The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.    In September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employersâ share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.    /web/20220301071254/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

The following also applies to visitors:  â¢	Operators may only admit visitors and accompanying persons if they present proof of 3G (vaccinated, recovered or tested).  â¢	Excluded from this are persons accompanying underage residents of inpatient residential facilities for the disabled, as well as for visits by palliative and hospice patients, for pastoral care and to accompany critical life events.    The following also applies to residents:  â¢	3G proof (vaccinated, recovered or tested) must be presented for new admissions.  â¢	Residents can be offered an antigen test or PCR test by operators at least every seven days, and if they have left the home within this period, at least every three days.    The following also applies to employees:   â¢	Operators may only let employees in if they present proof of 3G (vaccinated, recovered or tested).  â¢	This also applies to external service providers, residents' representatives, patient, disabled and nursing advocates, nursing supervisory bodies or members of established commissions.    In principle, the planned measures must not be disproportionate or lead to unreasonable hardship.    **In Vienna**  The 2G+ rule applies to visitors.  â¢	2 visitors per day are possible per patient  â¢	FFP2 mask, hand hygiene  â¢	Palliative care and hospice support as well as pastoral care for critical life events are excluded from this.    **In Carinthia**  Inpatient residential and care facilities for the elderly  Since January 17, 2022 (until March 31, 2022), additional measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in inpatient residential and nursing homes have been in place:  â¢	Access is only permitted for visitors if they can show 2G+ proof that was not older than 48 hours.   â¢	For employees, the 2G proof or a negative PCR test that was taken no more than 48 hours ago applies; in exceptional cases, if this is absolutely necessary to maintain service operations, a negative PCR test that was taken up to 72 hours ago can also be accepted.  â¢	""Boosted"" employees also have to show a negative PCR test once a week, employees without a booster vaccination three times a week.  â¢	The following applies to visitors and employees:  In the event of a positive PCR test result, entry into old people's and nursing homes is still permitted if there are at least 48 hours of symptoms after the infection has passed and based on the medical laboratory findings, in particular based on a CT value >30, it can be assumed that there is no longer any risk of infection.  â¢	The residents must be offered a PCR test at least once a week.
