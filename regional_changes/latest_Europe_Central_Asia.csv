The members of the Central Election Commission, the district and section commissions, with which the third phase of the plan has started, will be offered the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine. This ensures that the immunization is completed with two doses of the vaccine, so that those involved in the election can be maximally protected from the virus by election day. The overlap of the phases allows Bulgarian journalists, cameramen and photojournalists to be immunized in the third phase of the Plan.

In addition, the Federal Council is introducing stricter national measures with effect from Monday 18 January. All shops and markets other than those selling essential everyday goods are to close. It will still be possible to collect ordered goods.""     However, ""Service providers such as banks, hair salons, post offices and mobile phone stores are allowed to stay open but are subject to a curfew of 7pm and will have to close on Sunday. However, this curfew will no longer apply to kiosks and petrol station shops. Ski resorts are able to stay open provided they comply with protection measures.""     ON WORK FROM HOME:   ""From Monday, 18 January, there will be a requirement to work from home"", however, a closer inspection of policy reveals that it is only mandatory that ""Employers will be required to enable all staff to work from home where it is feasible and practicable for them to do so based on the type of activity. Employers will not be required to assume expenses incurred by employees for electricity or rent etc. as this is a temporary measure.""     While the policy text seems to allow some exceptions to the work from home, other analyses of this policy refer to it as a mandatory work from home requirement for non-essential workers.    ON CODING:   For now, this policy is coded as a 2G rather than 3G since employees in certain sectors still are able to go to work or choose not to work from home even when given the option. Furthermore, the consideration of ski resorts, hair salons, etc. as 'essential' fails to meet the threshold for 3G, which requires closure of ""all-but-essential workplaces"" like grocery stores.

B;C , Moderna & Pfizer    The following people are being given access to vaccinations first:    People age 75 and over  People with chronic diseases of the highest risk, regardless of their age  People who live in a retirement or care home. Staff who are in contact with residents of retirement and care homes also have the option of being vaccinated at the same time.  If you are in the group of people with chronic diseases of the highest risk, the doctor treating you will urgently recommend you to have the vaccination as soon as possible.    After that come:    People aged between 65 and 74  People under 65 and people with chronic diseases who have not yet been vaccinated  Following people at especially high risk (vulnerable people), the vaccination will also be offered to the following target groups in the corresponding order.    Target group 2: Healthcare professionals with patient contact/carers for people at especially high risk  Target group 3: Close contacts (household members or relatives providing care) of people at especially high risk  Target group 4: People in communal facilities with an increased risk of infection and outbreaks (for example homes for the handicapped).  It has become apparent that these priorities are being put into practice differently from canton to canton. In particular there are differences in the vaccination of healthcare professionals. For this reason the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) and the FOPH have drawn up guidelines specifying which groups of healthcare professionals may possibly be vaccinated at the same time as especially vulnerable people (target group 1). Given that volumes of vaccine are currently limited, the goal is to assure the provision of healthcare in areas that are particularly affected while making sufficient vaccine available for especially vulnerable people at the highest risk.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210205081724/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/impfen.html"

Incoming passengers should ensure that they are aware of, and comply with, all relevant public health restrictions that apply to the population in general.  Passengers travelling to Northern Ireland must ensure that they are familiar with the guidance and regulations in place, including the completion of a UK Passenger Locator Form.  Travel advice for passengers whose journey originates in Great Britain, South Africa, or any country in South America  All passengers who arrive from Great Britain, South Africa or any country in South America are advised to self isolate (stay in your room) for a period of 14 days following their arrival into Ireland.  All such travellers, whether they have symptoms or not, are asked to phone any GP or GP out-of-hours service to arrange for a COVID-19 test, which should be done as soon as possible after 5 days post-arrival. This test will be free of charge if arranged through GPs.  Please check the Irish College of General Practitioners website for a list of GPs with phone contact information, or the HSE website for your local GP out of hours service.  Taking this test will allow the HSE to identify suspect cases for new variants of COVID-19 and control its transmission in Ireland. Notwithstanding the result of this test, you are advised to complete the entire 14 days period of self-isolation.  If at any point in the 14 days following arrival, a traveller develops any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, they should immediately phone a GP and alert them of their recent visit from Great Britain, South Africa or South America.  Advice on restricting movement  The EU 'traffic lights' approach to travel applies to countries in the EU/EEA.  Nearly all of Europe has a high incidence of COVID-19 and is in a high-risk category (orange/red). If you are coming from red or grey regions, or from outside the EU/EEA, you should restrict your movements for 14 days.  This applies to all people entering the State, even if you have no symptoms. If you are unsure which risk area you are travelling from, please check the ECDC website.  See above for specific requirements regarding travel from Great Britain, South Africa and South America.  Restricting your movements means staying home or in your accommodation, and avoiding contact with other people, including those in your household that are at particular risk should they contract COVID-19. You should wear a face covering, including while indoors, to protect them.  You can go outside to exercise by yourself as long as you keep 2 metres away from other people. You should not meet or socialise with people outside your immediate household.  The request to restrict your movement means:  • do not go to work, unless you work on your own and can completely avoid other people  • do not go to school or college  • do not use public transport  • do not have visitors at your home  • do not visit others, even if you usually care for them  • do not go to the shops or pharmacy unless it's absolutely necessary - where possible, order your groceries online or have some family or friends drop them off  • do not go to gatherings such as weddings or funerals - information is available on bereavement and grief during COVID-19 here.  • do not meet face-to-face with older people, anyone with a long-term medical condition or pregnant women  You can find out more about restricting your movements on the HSE website.  Categories of passengers not requested to restrict their movements on arrival  In line with the EU traffic lights approach, the request to restrict movements does not apply to travellers from green regions or orange regions or those arriving from Northern Ireland.  Currently, all passengers entering Ireland from red and grey regions within the EU/EEA and from all non-EU/EEA countries are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days. See above for specific measures applying to travel from Great Britain, South Africa and South America.  This general request to restrict movement for 14 days does not apply to certain defined categories, as indicated below:  (a) International Transport Workers, including workers in aviation, maritime and road haulage sectors  (b) Those travelling with an essential function or need as set out in paragraph 19 of the EU Council Recommendation, including:  I. Passengers travelling for the purposes of an imperative business reason, only while carrying out that essential function  II. Passengers arriving for imperative family reasons, only while pursuing that imperative reason  III. Returning passengers, who have carried out an essential function in another region, but who have otherwise restricted their movement while in that region  It is the responsibility of individuals to determine whether their circumstances fall within one of the categories outlined in the EU Council Recommendation.  You can indicate on your Passenger Locator Form if you are travelling with an essential purpose as defined by Council Recommendation 2020/1475. You may be asked for evidence in support of this.  The information provided on this form will be used to provide you with public health information and COVID-19 advice and may be used for the purpose of contact tracing.  Imperative business reasons could include clients of State agencies or those whose attendance in person is critical to the functioning of a business. It is requested that those who consider their circumstances to be within this category carry supporting documentation from the state agency concerned or from a company CEO or Chairman or Director.  Imperative family reasons could include providing essential care to children, elderly or vulnerable people (in particular to those who live alone but excluding social family visits), exercising a right of access to a child, attending a court hearing, or attending a wedding or funeral. Those who consider their circumstances to be within this category should carry supporting documentation from relevant sources such as undertakers, clerics, social workers or solicitors.  Those who intend travelling should be aware that individual workplaces, schools, childcare facilities and colleges in Ireland can apply their own health and safety measures. Intending travellers, as well as parents/guardians, should familiarise themselves with these requirements before booking any travel    http://archive.today/pH3cG  https://archive.vn/0tCnS#selection-813.13-1473.304"

While the Kazakh students will continue their studies with distance learning, the new amendments allowed for educational institutions to organize a combined semester or academic quarter.    The updated law established a new working definition of distance learning as a concept and “the competence of an authorized body for the approval of the rules to organize distance learning, where the requirements and procedures for its implementation will be determined,” said Kazakh Minister of Education and Science Askhat Aimagambetov in a facebook post.    The amendments allow for university students to get back to traditional classrooms for applied classes in laboratories and seminars. Universities will be equipped with non-contact thermometers, sanitizers, and disinfectant tunnels.    The school children of the graduating class will have 70 percent of their classes in classrooms with no more than 15 people. In 2021, Kazakhstan will have more than 440,000 graduating class students.    The schoolchildren can also study and live in boarding schools, attend individual classes of no more than five people.

KZT 1.8 trillion is allocated to support employment under an “Employment Roadmap” program, including some large-scale projects to modernize the transportation infrastructure. Selected enterprises and individual entrepreneurs are also eligible for new tax incentives. Further measures recently announced to restore economic growth include: a subsidized mortgage program for households with a segment targeting youth specifically, tax incentives to agriculture and hard-hit sectors (civil aviation, tourism), credit support to SMEs and manufacturing enterprises (the latter via a newly created industry development fund), and infrastructure development. Following the reintroduction of the quarantine in early July, the authorities provided additional cash transfers to individuals who lost their jobs due to the quarantine, lowered subsidized interest rates for SME loans (to 6 percent), and extended tax concessions for vulnerable individuals and businesses.Some supportive measures (e.g. “Employment Roadmap” and working capital support to SMEs) are expected to continue in 2021.""    __________________________________________________________________________________  Web Archived Link:  http://archive.today/2021.02.15-163514/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19%23top"
