"26","Albania","ALB",2022-02-22,"Europe_Central_Asia","E1: Income support","1G","1G","The government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable which were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 98 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.    The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.    In September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employersâ share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.    /web/20220301071254/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Three main changes now apply:     - The end of the obligation to wear a mask outdoors for elementary school students and staff;  - The possibility of practicing physical and sports activities indoors again without wearing a mask (respecting a distance: contact sports are therefore not allowed without a mask);  - The lightening of the rules limiting social mixing (by level or group of classes rather than by class), especially during break times.    In addition, legal guardians of students who have been in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case in their class will no longer be obliged to send a signed ""Declaration of Honour"" that their child has completed the proscribed regime of self-testing in order for them to return to school after isolation, and that testing regime will be relaxed to one self-test rather than two from 28 February.

Proof of Vaccination or Negative COVID Test Required for Most Businesses and Public Services:  As of Monday, November 22, 2021, the Government of Greece has restricted access for unvaccinated individuals to many categories of businesses and public services if they cannot prove vaccination or recovery from COVID-19.  Customers seeking access to these facilities are required to present a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or documentation of recovery from COVID-19.  Under the new rules, unvaccinated adults:  Cannot access/enter: Enclosed eating areas, entertainment facilities (cinemas, theaters), museums, exhibition centers, fitness centers and sports venues. These facilities may be accessed only by those who are fully vaccinated or have documentation of recovery from COVID-19.  Can enter only with a negative lab rapid test or PCR test: Unvaccinated individuals seeking access to churches, schools, public and private sector places of work, retail shops, hair salons, or outdoor eating areas may enter by presenting a negative laboratory rapid test no older than 48 hours OR a PCR test no older than 72 hours.  Can enter with no documentation required: Unvaccinated individuals can enter supermarkets, bakeries, sweet shops, pharmacies and urban public transportation.  Children aged 4 to 17 may access the top two categories of facilities with a negative self-test taken within the last 24 hours, documented via the Self-Test Declaration form. Children under four do not need to show any documentation.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220320124858/https://gr.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
