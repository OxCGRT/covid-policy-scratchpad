Persons with COVID-19 symptoms should isolate and get tested as quickly as possible.  2. Anyone with symptoms should be kept separate from the other children, pupils, students and employees until they can be collected or sent home, and all of the probable contact points must be cleaned (e.g. the seating in the classroom, doorknobs, handles, handrails etc., that the person or child with symptoms may have touched).  A negative PCR test will mean the tested person or child is no longer suspected of having COVID-19.  If it is ascertained there is infection among the pupils or teachers, the next steps will be clarified in collaboration with the municipality and the National Board of Health in Greenland (âLandslÃ¦geembedetâ) in accordance with the applicable rules for the area.    Basic principles for handling cases in relation to primary schools and day care institutions:  1.The day care institution or primary school should not allow any child or pupil who is infected or who is a close contact of an infected child or pupil from attending the institution or primary school.  2. The pupils can be tested, if required several times, rather than sending them home. The times for testing will depend on the specific case.  3. Children who do not have COVID-19 symptoms and whose parents do not want them to be tested, are recommended to remain at home for 14 days after their last near contact with the infected person.  4. Parents or other family members or people who live with the children who are near contacts, only need to pay extra attention to the infection prevention advice, including in relation to hygiene and airing out.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206122147/https://corona.nun.gl/en/at-the-workplace/guidelines-for-primary-schools-day-care-and-after-school-activities/"
