Defined framework conditions also enable flexible measures to be taken at the school location.""    *Vorarlberg*  In its meeting on October 14th, 2021, the Corona Commission determined that the schools in Vorarlberg will remain in risk level 1 .    Test and mask requirement:  Schoolchildren: There is no MNS requirement in the entire school building and there is no longer any compulsory test.

Teaching and administrative staff: There is no MNS obligation in the entire school building. For staff who have not been vaccinated / have not recovered, an external PCR test must still be submitted once a week; further antigen tests must be carried out at the school. Vaccinated and convalescents can voluntarily test themselves with antigen tests.  External persons must present a 3-G certificate and wear MNS during their entire stay at the school.

As of Oct. 12, entry is permitted for UK travelers arriving from the UK, a European Union member state, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland provided they present a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival, as well as a certificate of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery; travelers that do not possess a certificate indicating COVID-19 vaccination or recovery may enter Bulgaria but must self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival.    Authorities have also moved France, Monaco, Portugal, Cyprus, and Iceland into the green list of countries while moving Malaysia, Eswatini, Iran, Macedonia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, the U.S., and Ireland to the orange list of countries. Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, and Singapore are to be considered red-list countries from Oct. 13.    Authorities in Bulgaria classify countries as green, orange, or red based on local disease activity and accordingly apply differing entry restrictions. Travelers from green and orange countries can enter upon presenting a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document confirming vaccination against COVID-19, recovery from COVID-19, or a recent negative test for the disease. Travelers without such documentation must isolate for 10 days on arrival, though isolation can be ended early following receipt of a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours after arrival.    Travel from red countries is permitted for EU citizens, their families, and persons traveling for selected essential purposes only. Permitted travelers from red countries must present a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document indicating vaccination against or recovery from COVID-19, in addition to a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival and certified by a valid EU Digital COVID certificate or similar document. Limited categories of travelers are permitted to enter by only satisfying the PCR test requirement, but must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival.      Citizens and residents of Romania, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, and North Macedonia who also travel daily or weekly to Bulgaria for work or study may enter the country without restrictions; these travelers do not need to show COVID-19-related documentation to enter Bulgaria. The same rules apply to Bulgarian citizens and residents who travel daily or weekly for work or study to these five neighboring countries. Freight transporters and aircraft crews are also exempt from the documentation requirement.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211101215018/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/533771/bulgaria-authorities-amend-covid-19-related-entry-restrictions-as-of-oct-12-easing-entry-controls-for-uk-travelers-update-36"

Central to these guidelines is a commitment to adhering to best practice in infection prevention control measures which are necessary to protect individuals and society, as well as supporting our continued progress towards a full return to operation of our sector as the epidemiological situation allows.    The measures outlined in this document are intended to assist organisers by:  ? Limiting the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak due to event operations and venue  management through Infection Prevention and Control measures;  ? Ensuring business continuity through resource planning and avoiding loss of key personnel  due to illness or being identified as close contacts while at work; and  ? Safeguarding against reputational damage through implementation of these measures.    These guidelines apply to venues operating for the purposes of live entertainment or nightclubs which  meet the following essential conditions:  Nightclubs/Premises covered by these guidelines must meet the following conditions:  - Must be the holder of a current and valid on licence or theatre licence.  - Must have been granted by the Court a special exemption order or occasional licence for  each occasion they intend to operate beyond normal licensing hours.  - Must comply with the conditions of the special exemption order, occasional licence, dance  licence and/or music and singing licences attaching to the premises.  - Must, on 22 October, have a designated performance area, stage or booth for performers  and will typically also have a specialist sound and lighting system.  - Must, on 22 October, have a designated dance floor or standing or seating area which are  specifically utilised only for the purposes of viewing a performance.  - Must generally cease operation at the end of the performance, having regard to normal  licensing arrangements.  - Events must be ticketed (electronic) to facilitate contact tracing.

Using the entry pass system reduces the likelihood of the virus circulating at these locations. Only admitting people who have recovered from COVID-19, have been vaccinated or have tested negative considerably lowers the risk of infection for all visitors. Although the system cannot rule out the possibility of becoming infected, it does ensure that people can come together as safely as possible. It also helps to keep most locations open at full capacity.    It is important that all locations where a coronavirus entry pass is required scan the pass and check the personâs ID. All visitors must show their personal QR code and a valid form of ID.    Coronavirus entry passes are required from 6 November:     at establishments serving food and drinks, both indoors and in outdoor seating areas, except for takeaway;  at casinos;  at cultural locations such as theatres, music venues and cinemas;  at locations where there is a continuous flow of visitors in sectors where coronavirus entry passes are already required. This includes museums and historic buildings;  at events with a continuous flow of visitors who do not have an assigned seat, such as fun fairs and certain sports events;  at events such as festivals and live performances, whether or not visitors have an assigned seat;  at business events, such as trade fairs and conferences;  for spectators at professional and amateur sports matches and competitions. Spectators under the age of 18 at amateur sports matches and competitions are exempt from this requirement;  when taking part in organised sports activities from the age of 18. This includes gyms, group lessons, football and swimming. This applies to participants and spectators at all indoor and outdoor sports facilities, including sports canteens and clubhouses;  when taking part in artistic and cultural activities from the age of 18, such as music and painting lessons and singing, dance and theatre rehearsals.  Organised activities for children aged under 18 are exempt from the coronavirus entry pass requirement.    You can get a coronavirus entry pass if you are fully vaccinated, have valid proof of recovery or a negative result from a coronavirus test taken less than 24 hours before entry. For people without proof of vaccination or recovery, getting tested for entry will remain free of charge.    You can generate a coronavirus entry pass using the CoronaCheck app on your mobile phone. You can also show a coronavirus entry pass on paper. Staff at hospitality establishments and organisers of events, sports matches and cultural activities can download the CoronaCheck Scanner app, so that they can easily check the validity of entry passes.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20211104095524/https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/news/2021/11/02/press-conference-2-november-2021"

On the same day, the government also introduced a ban on leaving oneâs home municipality (these are 212 small territorial areas with a median number of inhabitants of around 5,000; the smallest two municipalities have some 350 inhabitants) [32]. There were some exceptions, such as crossing over the boundaries of a municipality to visit family members in need of protection, assistance, support, or nursing care. Crossing between municipalities was also allowed for the purpose of visiting, e.g., grocery shops or pharmacies, if none existed in oneâs own municipality. The reason for moving between municipalities had to be proved with appropriate documents.    For the elderly population and those with physical disabilities, the introduced measure about visiting grocery stores was insufficient because they were unable to complete their shopping by 10 AM. Especially vulnerable were individuals whose social supporters all came from other municipalities. Therefore, representatives of different governmental and non-governmental organizations suggested extending the opening hours for vulnerable groups [33], as happened on April 4 [34], allowing them to also visit grocery stores in the last hour of opening.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247993"

However, the Public Health Agency recommends that vaccination be given after pregnancy week 12, unless there are other reasons. For example, you may have a medical risk factor such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes or are over 35 years of age.    Most people who become ill with Covid-19 experience mild symptoms of illness and do not need to seek medical care. But pregnant women have a slightly higher risk of becoming seriously ill. Vaccination against Covid-19 is recommended for all pregnant women, as the vaccines provide good protection against serious illness and reduce the risk of early delivery.    About pregnancy and vaccines from the Public Health Agency    Children and young people   All people, twelve years and older, are offered Covid-19 vaccination.    Each region determines how they handle consent when vaccinating minors. Some regions send a consent form in connection with the booking, others make a maturity assessment at the time of vaccination.     The Swedish Public Health Agency has decided to suspend the use of Modernaâs Spikevax vaccine for everyone born in 1991 or later.    COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 12â15, The Public Health Agency of Sweden    Those with immunodeficiency  If you are over 18 years of age and have a severely impaired immune system due to a disease or medical treatment, it is recommended that you take an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It is your treating doctor who will prescribe the extra dose after an individual assessment.    The Elderly  The Swedish Public Health Agency (""FolkhÃ¤lsomyndigheten"") recommends that people at increased risk of severe Covid-19 be offered a vaccine booster. This includes those who live in care homes, those with home health care or home care and everyone who is 80 years and older.
