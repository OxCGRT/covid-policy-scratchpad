Mouth and nose protection can be dispensed with at the workplace as long as there is no customer contact or protection is provided with appropriate mechanical protective measures (e.g. a plexiglass pane).

A mouth and nose protection (MNS) is a mechanical protection device that covers the mouth and nose area, which covers the mouth and nose and must also fit snugly. The MNS is to be fixed either with rubber bands or fabric straps. The material has to form a mechanical barrier in order to avoid the splashing of droplets when speaking, coughing and sneezing. The use of face shields (so-called ""Face Shields"" or ""Mini Face Shields"") is not permitted. An exception for face visors applies to people who can show a medical certificate confirming that they cannot wear an MNS for health reasons (e.g. asthmatics).

People who test positive will now receive a text message if the unit fails to inform them via phone the same day their results are out.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201202182827/https://cyprus-mail.com/2020/10/16/coronavirus-contact-tracing-unit-swamped-after-surge-in-cases/    https://web.archive.org/web/20201202183105/https://cyprus-mail.com/2020/10/23/coronavirus-text-messages-part-of-new-directions-for-contact-tracing/"

To achieve this, antigenic tests will be generalized in the short term, in addition to RT-PCRs, which remain the reference. More than 5 million tests have already been ordered and are made available to health establishments and ARS. These tests are CE marked and meet, according to the manufacturer's declarations, the minimum technical specifications provided by the High Authority for Health (sensitivity> 80%, specificity> 99%), which issued two opinions on the subject, the September 25 and October 9.https://covid-19.sante.gouv.fr/tests ).  Several screening campaigns have been initiated in universities, in particular for health students. This is for example the case in Ile-de-France with campaigns at the Faculty of Medicine of Sorbonne, Necker or even in a Nursing Training Institute in Paris. Other campaigns are being carried out in nursing homes to ensure screening of asymptomatic staff, particularly in the Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Ile-de-France regions. These campaigns are in progress and an assessment could be drawn up later. The ministry wanted to broaden the experiments and deployment channels across the country very quickly.  In addition, liberal health professionals (pharmacists, nurses and doctors) are now authorized to carry out these rapid antigenic tests, ensuring a large-scale deployment and closer to the population.  https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19"

Private laboratories also offer testing, but this is not free.     The Luxembourg government is embarking on a new phase of screening with the aim to test representative samples of the population in order to monitor developments and to be as flexible as possible in the event of an increase in the number of cases. This is the best way to break infection chains and effectively trace the contacts of infected people.    The COVID-19 test at the invitation of the Luxembourg Government concerns residents and cross-border workers. It is free of charge.    The Large Scale Testing strategy divides people into representative groups, e.g. according to business sector, age and place of residence. This means that members of the same household, residents of a residential area or a circle of colleagues receive invitations deliberately staggered by several weeks according to the targeted samples. This also makes it possible to maintain continuous testing. It is therefore a strategy based on a large scale sampling approach. This organised exercise makes it possible to control and keep the rate of infections at a very low level and thus ensure the protection of everyone. The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and protects us all.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201130213106/https://covid19.public.lu/en/testing.html"
