This model also allows for students in grades 4-12 to continue learning from home.      Education Commissioner Racquel Berry-Benjamin made the announcement during the Government House Jan. 14 press briefing, alongside Assistant Commissioner Victor Somme III, and District Superintendents Carlos McGregor and Stefan Jurgen, PhD.     The decision to reopen campuses on a rolling basis, and not on the previously announced date of Jan. 25, has to do with the Territory’s recent spike in COVID-19 cases, as well as lengthy delays in the shipment of critical items needed for schools to safely reopen—namely, automatic soap and hand sanitizer dispensers. As these fixtures arrive and are installed, campuses will reopen.
