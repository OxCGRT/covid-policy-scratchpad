Without this email you will not be allowed to board the flight coming into Dominica.    A pinprick Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) will be taken on arrival. If the RDT is negative, then the traveller must self-isolate in a government operated or government certified facility for five days before having a further PCR test.
