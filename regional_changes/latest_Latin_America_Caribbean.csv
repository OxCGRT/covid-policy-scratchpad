Last week, President Luis Arce approved a decree so that all people who go to public places must carry their vaccine card with a complete schedule, that is, with two doses of one of the brands Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Sputnik V or one unique to Johnson & Johnson.  Those who for different reasons reject the vaccine, must carry a PCR or antigenic test carried out 48 hours before attending a public place. Because this Saturday is a national holiday, the public administration and banks, for example, were closed, but the document began to be required at airports or land travel terminals.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220307222517/https://www.lanacion.com.py/mundo/2022/01/01/en-bolivia-desde-hoy-exigen-el-carne-de-vacunacion-anti-covid-para-ingresar-a-eventos/"
