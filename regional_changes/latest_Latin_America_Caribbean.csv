PCR, serology-based antibody tests, and antigen tests are available. Turn-around time varies widely depending upon location.  Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test. Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo and GaleÃ£o International Airport in Rio de Janeiro.
