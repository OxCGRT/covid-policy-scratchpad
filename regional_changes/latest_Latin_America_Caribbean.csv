You should also check requirements with your airline.    From 5 January 2022, travellers arriving from the UK will need a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate from their country of origin and a PCR test taken within 72 hours before travel.    Children under the age of 12 are exempt from providing vaccination certificates or PCR test results. Adults who have a medical certificate proving they are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are exempt from providing vaccination certificates.    Demonstrating your COVID-19 status  Cuba will accept the UKâs proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.    Screening and quarantine  Visitors are no longer required to routinely self-isolate or take a PCR test on arrival in Cuba, but sanitary authorities are present at the airport and will carry out random PCR tests. Anyone testing positive on arrival will be moved to quarantine in a designated government health centre, at their own expense. Direct contacts of those testing positive will either be moved to a designated government health centre or allowed to self-isolate in their own accommodation depending on their circumstances. Foreign arrivals registered with international schools, those with scholarships at Cuban institutions, technicians and other foreign collaborators will be required to do 8 daysâ quarantine at the relevant quarantine centre linked to their institution, and will take a PCR test on the seventh day after their arrival.    Completion of a Health Declaration (DeclaracÃ­on Jurada de Sanidad) is required for all travellers and can be completed online before travel or in paper form on arrival. From the beginning of January 2022 it will become compulsory for the declaration to be completed online before travel.    https://archive.fo/X2hbN"
