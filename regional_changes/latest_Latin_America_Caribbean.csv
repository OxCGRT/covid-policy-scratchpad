Persons arriving from Canada, however, are allowed to be tested on arrival in Barbados, if they are unable to receive their test results in time for departure from their country. All high risk passengers are required to quarantine at a designated hotel or approved villa at their own expense or free of charge at a government facility, up to the time of a second test, which will be four to five days after the first test. At the end of the period, if they test negative, they are discharged from quarantine, but will continue to be monitored for seven days from the time of arrival.    Passengers from medium risk countries are monitored for seven days after arrival and must also undergo a second test within four to five days.    Persons from low risk countries are strongly advised to have a negative test taken within five days of arrival, and those who arrive without it will be tested on arrival.

Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September).

""After the concerns expressed by some sectors of society, we have deemed it pertinent to make the following clarifications regarding the new social distancing measures adopted by the Government this December 15 through Decree 698-20,"" said Germán.      Here are the details:    ""Now we have two different hours for the curfew, depending on the locality. On the one hand, in the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo, Santiago, Duarte, La Vega and Puerto Plata this applies every day from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am ”, explained Germán.      While, in the rest of the country, the curfew applies from Monday to Friday from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. and Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.     The spokesperson for the Presidency clarified the limitations of the new measures in relation to transfer to homes. “At these times that we have indicated, all curfew restrictions begin to apply, including the closure of public spaces, with the only exception that those days and places in which the curfew begins at 7: 00 pm, a two-hour grace period has been granted, that is, until 9:00 pm with the exclusive purpose that people can move quietly home, without the anguish that they will be detained for reasons beyond their control, such as the traffic jams that usually take place in hours close to curfew ”.    He added: “Regarding the gathering of people, it has been prohibited for more than 10 people to gather in public and private spaces for public use. This means that in these spaces more than 10 people can coincide at the same time, but they cannot gather in groups larger than that amount, as would happen in a shopping plaza, a transport station or a park ”.    The same restriction applies to establishments such as restaurants and bars, where tables cannot be occupied by more than 10 people and always respecting the sanitary protocols of the sector, such as not exceeding 70% of the total capacity of the premises.      “Finally, we wish to highlight that all the traffic exceptions during the curfew hours that we had previously, such as those relating to doctors and nurses and other health personnel, the one relating to international passengers heading or they return from the airport or the operators of vehicles dedicated to the distribution of food, supplies, fuels and other essential products, among other cases that can be detailed in article 4 of Decree 698-20, ""he said.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201221140355/https://presidencia.gob.do/noticias/la-portavoz-de-la-presidencia-detalla-el-alcance-de-las-medidas-del-toque-de-queda"

Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. This result must be uploaded and submitted with the questionnaire so that your arrival can be approved by email from the Dominican Ministry of Health. Without this email you will not be allowed to board the flight coming into Dominica.    A pinprick Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) will be taken on arrival. If the RDT is negative, then the traveller must self-isolate in a government operated or government certified facility for five days before having a further PCR test. If the RDT is positive, then a further PCR swab test will be carried out. This will be at the traveller’s expense. Further information can be found via the Dominica Hotel and Tourist Association certified booking line at +1 (767) 615-0551.    If the PCR test is positive a mandatory 14 day quarantine will be necessary, in a government facility for which fees will be charged.    The results of the second PCR test are likely to take at least 48 hours. Once a negative test is received the next seven days can be spent at an uncertified premises but the traveller should remain inside and monitor their temperature.
