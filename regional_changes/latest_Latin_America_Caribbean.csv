This is welcome news as it should provide a welcome boost to tourism from the Netherlands. Charter company TUI had previously indicated that they would resume flights as soon as Aruba is back to code yellow. Code orange is defined as “Only travel if you have to. There are health and safety risks, an entry ban and / or quarantine obligation.” Code yellow is defined as “You can travel, but be vigilant, there are risks.”. The Dutch code yellow classification does not mean that people from the Netherlands do not need to provide proof of a negative test or take a test on arrival – testing remains a requirement by Aruba for entry. https://web.archive.org/web/20201122123113/https:/www.visitaruba.com/news/general/corona-virus-and-travel-to-aruba/"

All high risk passengers are required to quarantine at a designated hotel or approved villa at their own expense or free of charge at a government facility, up to the time of a second test, which will be four to five days after the first test.

Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September).

Persons who are not required to pre-test may be required to be tested at the airport or other designated facility, if assessed by the health authorities as high-risk based on health screening and risk assessment on arrival. For persons required to be tested for COVID-19, the test will be a PCR test and a sample will be taken by oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabbing. They will then await their test results under quarantine at their hotel/intended address.    Whether or not persons are required to be tested, they will be required to remain in quarantine at home for 14 days from their date of entry to Jamaica. If persons are required to be tested and their test is negative, they will be required to remain in quarantine at home for 14 days from their date of entry to Jamaica.
