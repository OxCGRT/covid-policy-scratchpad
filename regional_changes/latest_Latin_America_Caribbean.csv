Dominica,DMA,07-Jun-21,C8: International travel controls,"As of 7 June 2021, authorities in Dominica ease certain COVID-19 travel requirements for fully vaccinated individuals (consider fully vaccinated individuals as those who received the final dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine more than two weeks before entering Dominica).  These individuals must follow the following guidelines to enter the country, regardless of their country of origin:  - Submit a health questionnaire online at least 24 hours before arrival in Dominica.  - Proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 24-72 hours before arrival.  - Upon arrival, they will undergo a health assessment and enter a government-operated quarantine facility or an approved property for at least 48 hours. On day two, they will take another COVID-19 test and remain in quarantine until obtaining the results; if negative, the quarantine may end; if positive, authorities will transport them to a COVID-19 isolation unit.    Persons who are not fully vaccinated must also take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 24-72 hours before departure for Dominica, submit the health questionnaire online at least 24 hours before arrival, and undergo a health assessment upon arrival. Additional requirements for unvaccinated travelers vary depending on their country of origin.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210614105901/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/487686/dominica-authorities-ease-restrictions-for-travelers-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-as-of-june-7-update-18",Latin_America_Caribbean,2,2
