If this test is negative, they can end the quarantine.

Most nonresident foreign nationals must be fully vaccinated and provide proof of medical insurance to enter the country. Individuals admitted entry who are not fully vaccinated (e.g. unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Argentine nationals and residents, as well as close family members of Argentine nationals and residents) are subject to an on-arrival antigen test, a mandatory seven-day quarantine, and a further COVID-19 test between days five and seven following their arrival; exceptions for quarantine measures exist for minors under the age of 18.    Select international airports in the country have reopened, with the majority of international flights serving routes to/from Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires' seaport is also open to international arrivals. Land border crossings remain limited to ""safe corridors"" opened with the joint permission of national and provincial authorities. Generally, international cargo, medical, and humanitarian transport operations are running normally nationwide; however, truck drivers and aircraft flight crews may be subject to enhanced screening measures.

You should also check requirements with your airline.    From 5 January 2022, travellers arriving from the UK will need a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate from their country of origin and a PCR test taken within 72 hours before travel.    Children under the age of 12 are exempt from providing vaccination certificates or PCR test results. Adults who have a medical certificate proving they are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are exempt from providing vaccination certificates.    Demonstrating your COVID-19 status  Cuba will accept the UKâs proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.    Screening and quarantine  Visitors are no longer required to routinely self-isolate or take a PCR test on arrival in Cuba, but sanitary authorities are present at the airport and will carry out random PCR tests. Anyone testing positive on arrival will be moved to quarantine in a designated government health centre, at their own expense. Direct contacts of those testing positive will either be moved to a designated government health centre or allowed to self-isolate in their own accommodation depending on their circumstances. Foreign arrivals registered with international schools, those with scholarships at Cuban institutions, technicians and other foreign collaborators will be required to do 8 daysâ quarantine at the relevant quarantine centre linked to their institution, and will take a PCR test on the seventh day after their arrival.    Completion of a Health Declaration (DeclaracÃ­on Jurada de Sanidad) is required for all travellers and can be completed online before travel or in paper form on arrival. From the beginning of January 2022 it will become compulsory for the declaration to be completed online before travel.    https://archive.fo/X2hbN"
