The plan was presented by Minister MarÃ­a Brown on 4 November 2021. Juan Zapata, president of the National COE, confirmed to El Comercio that the proposal is being analysed and has been referred to the COE's health and education committees.    The Ministry of Education's proposal consists of a staggered return. The proposed schedule begins on 22 November with schools in rural areas and technical high school students, who were the first to receive the vaccine against covid-19.    After that, students from 12 to 17 years of age, who have already received the first dose, are scheduled to return to school. Students from the age of five are scheduled to return to school in January. In order to make this decision, the COE will analyse aspects such as the progress of vaccination among teachers and students, the plans developed by the educational institutions, the indicators of the students who are already in classes, among others.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211025144632/https://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/sociedad/estudiantes-profesores-contagios-clases-presenciales.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211025145314/https://www.worldbank.org/en/data/interactive/2020/03/24/world-bank-education-and-covid-19  https://web.archive.org/web/20211108222042/https://elmercurio.com.ec/2021/11/08/educacion-propone-el-regreso-progresivo-y-obligatorio-a-clases-presenciales-desde-el-22-de-noviembre/"

Example: In BolÃ­var, the CristÃ³bal Mendoza and Los PrÃ³ceres de Puerto Ordaz schools suspended face-to-face classes because people with covid symptoms were registered. In MÃ©rida , the MonseÃ±or Bosset and Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Rosario schools closed their doors this week, for reasons related to COVID-19. In the last one, only one case corresponding to a student was detected. In Zulia, in the west of the country, four schools wrote official notices and classrooms stopped for 14 or 15 days.
