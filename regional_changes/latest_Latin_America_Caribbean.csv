Fully vaccinated travelers arriving from these areas may provide proof of full vaccination in lieu of a negative test result. This measure also applies to those with travel histories in the aforementioned countries during the 14-day period prior to their arrival in the Dominican Republic.    Authorities do not require arrivals from other locations to present a negative test result. Nevertheless, some travelers arriving by air are randomly selected for rapid testing upon arrival at the airport; persons testing positive will be required to enter quarantine. Individuals who present a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival or proof of full vaccination are exempt from random testing.    All travelers must also complete an entry and exit (e-Ticket) form, which combines the traveler's Health Affidavit, Customs Declaration, and International Embarkation/Disembarkation forms.
