If this test is negative, they can end the quarantine.

Most nonresident foreign nationals must be fully vaccinated and provide proof of medical insurance to enter the country. Individuals admitted entry who are not fully vaccinated (e.g. unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Argentine nationals and residents, as well as close family members of Argentine nationals and residents) are subject to an on-arrival antigen test, a mandatory seven-day quarantine, and a further COVID-19 test between days five and seven following their arrival; exceptions for quarantine measures exist for minors under the age of 18.    Select international airports in the country have reopened, with the majority of international flights serving routes to/from Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires' seaport is also open to international arrivals. Land border crossings remain limited to ""safe corridors"" opened with the joint permission of national and provincial authorities. Generally, international cargo, medical, and humanitarian transport operations are running normally nationwide; however, truck drivers and aircraft flight crews may be subject to enhanced screening measures.
