The resumption of face to face classes was announced by Minister for Education, Human Resource Planning, Vocational Training and National Excellence, Hon. Octavia Alfred at a press conference on Friday March 4. According to her, Cabinet has decided that all primary and secondary schools will be open for in-person learning from Monday 7th March 2022, utilizing a blended approach, that is online and face to face. The general arrangement is that all form five and all Grade 6 students at all schools will be in daily, and the rest of the space at the schools will be used to rotate the rest of the school population. Small schools with a population of eighty students or less with adequate space for the stipulated 3 to 6 feet social distancing will be fully open. We have about four schools with less than 81 students but they do not have the required space so they will fall under the arrangement for schools with a population between 81 and 200 students. These schools will operate under a blended approach with grade six students coming in every day, while Grades K, 1, 2 and 3 come in from Mondays to Wednesdays, and Grades 4 and 5 on Thursdays and Fridays. All primary schools will operate from 9 to 2, however the primary schools who operate from 8 to 1 will continue to do so. At secondary schools all Form 5 students will be in Monday to Friday from 8 to 1. Forms 3 and 4 will go in Mondays to Wednesday forms 1 and 2 students will attend Thursdays and Fridays. The Dominica Grammar School and the Goodwill Secondary School will continue to work on shift. The Dominica Community High School has just 61 students and enough space to accommodate all the students every day. The days when children are not engaged online they will be doing face to face and the days when they are not at school they will be engaged online.

Travellers aged 18 years and older must be able to prove their full vaccination status by presenting evidence of a full vaccination scheme.     Travellers aged 17 years and under are exempt from presenting proof of vaccination.    Only travellers who have completed 2 weeks since their final dose are considered fully vaccinated. Paraguay recognises as final the second dose in a two-dose vaccination scheme or a single dose in a single-dose vaccination scheme.    All travellers aged 12 years and older â regardless of vaccination status â are also required to show a negative COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 48 hours before travel, or a negative antigen test taken up to 24 hours before travel.    All travellers must present evidence of international health insurance, that includes COVID-19 coverage and undertake a COVID-19 PCR test on the 5th day after the pre-travel test â if still in Paraguay at that date. If the test comes back positive, the traveller will have to isolate for 7 days.    Travellers who do not have a full vaccination scheme may be refused entry and deported unless they fall into the listed specific categories: Foreign nationals with residency in Paraguay who are not vaccinated or have an incomplete vaccination scheme: Humanitarian reasons for unvaccinated non-resident foreigners; Foreign investors, entrepreneurs and specialised technicians who need to enter the country for a maximum stay of up to 7 days.      /web/20220325132531/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/entry-requirements    /web/20220325125144/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/coronavirus"
