"849","United States Virgin Islands","VIR",2021-01-18,"Latin_America_Caribbean","C1: School closing","2G","2G","""The Virgin Islands Department of Education will reopen its public-school campuses on a rolling basis throughout the months of February and March using a hybrid instructional model, which will provide in-person instruction to students in grades PreK-3, students with special needs, and students enrolled in Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes. This model also allows for students in grades 4-12 to continue learning from home.      Education Commissioner Racquel Berry-Benjamin made the announcement during the Government House Jan. 14 press briefing, alongside Assistant Commissioner Victor Somme III, and District Superintendents Carlos McGregor and Stefan Jurgen, PhD.     The decision to reopen campuses on a rolling basis, and not on the previously announced date of Jan. 25, has to do with the Territory’s recent spike in COVID-19 cases, as well as lengthy delays in the shipment of critical items needed for schools to safely reopen—namely, automatic soap and hand sanitizer dispensers. As these fixtures arrive and are installed, campuses will reopen.
