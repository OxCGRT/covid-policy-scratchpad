Fully vaccinated refers to having a complete course/regimen of vaccination at least two weeks prior to travel. Travellers with a mixed vaccination regimen are considered fully vaccinated.    In addition, passengers arriving into Guyana must obtain a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within seven days prior to their arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to Guyana. You should arrange a private test. If you arrive with a test completed within 72 hours you will be allowed immediate entry into Guyana without restrictions.
