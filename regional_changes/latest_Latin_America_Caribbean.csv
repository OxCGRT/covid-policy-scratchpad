Many local hospitals, clinics, and laboratories offer private testing for travel purposes.  The cost of PCR tests typically range from approximately 950 MXN to 4500 MXN, and the cost of viral antigen tests typically range from 200 MXN to 1000 MXN, depending on location and speed of results.  Travelers are responsible for the costs of their own tests and any associated medical care.  The Embassy and Consulates are unable to administer or pay for tests.  U.S. Mission Mexico has prepared a list of private testing providers.  Note: This list is not comprehensive and the information within is subject to change at any time.  The Department of State assumes no responsibility or liability for the professional ability or reputation of, or the quality of services provided by, the entities or individuals whose names appear on this list.  Inclusion on this list is in no way an endorsement by the Department or the U.S. government.  Providers are listed by location, and the order in which they appear has no other significance. The information on the list is provided directly by local service providers; the Department of State is unable to vouch for this information.  Travelers visiting Mexico should contact their tour provider or hotel for more information on local testing options.  You will have to pay for your test.  You should contact your medical/travel insurance to find out if they will reimburse you.

Sandino International Airport (MGA) in Managua remains open, and domestic flights and cargo transportation continue to operate. All travelers arriving in Nicaragua must present a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. Nonresident foreign nationals showing symptoms of the disease will not be permitted to enter, while citizens and legal residents who show symptoms are required to self-quarantine.    The government has not officially announced any closures of its land and sea ports of entry or any significant restrictions on domestic movements and business operations. However, some sea vessels have been denied entry. Disruptions to travel at land, sea, and air ports of entry will likely persist despite the borders being opened. Heightened screening measures at the land borders could cause some delays to cargo transportation and other cross-border travel.

This model also allows for students in grades 4-12 to continue learning from home.      Education Commissioner Racquel Berry-Benjamin made the announcement during the Government House Jan. 14 press briefing, alongside Assistant Commissioner Victor Somme III, and District Superintendents Carlos McGregor and Stefan Jurgen, PhD.     The decision to reopen campuses on a rolling basis, and not on the previously announced date of Jan. 25, has to do with the Territory’s recent spike in COVID-19 cases, as well as lengthy delays in the shipment of critical items needed for schools to safely reopen—namely, automatic soap and hand sanitizer dispensers. As these fixtures arrive and are installed, campuses will reopen.
