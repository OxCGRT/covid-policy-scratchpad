""The Ministry of Health and Wellness is currently monitoring two COVID-19 clusters on the West Coast of Barbados.  This development was revealed last evening during a press briefing to apprise the nation of the status of a large cluster of cases at Her Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Dodds – 161 so far – which have been linked to a bus crawl held on Saturday, December 26, 2020.  Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kenneth George, revealed that in addition to this, there were two smaller clusters – one with seven positive cases and the other with four. Additionally, there were two other cases under investigation.  “And those clusters have been brought to the attention of the Ministry of Health, and we have put several resources in this to make sure that the contact tracing is complete. The contact tracing is not done overnight. It’s a process, and as we get more information, we will certainly pass it on to you,” he stated.

Mexican authorities may perform temperature checks and health inspections at the international ports of entry and between municipalities. Southbound U.S. citizen travelers who display symptoms of COVID-19 or who decline to have their temperature checked may be denied entry to Mexico. Mexican authorities recommend that private vehicles have less than two people in them (the driver and one passenger) and all occupants wear face masks/coverings.

People who are transiting the border or moving within the state frequently for work should carry a letter attesting to their employment and the essential nature of their movements.    In major cities in Tamaulipas, certain vehicles are prohibited from being driven one day per week, depending on the last digit of the license plate, under the Hoy No Circula program. This measure applies to national and foreign vehicles. In certain municipalities of Tamaulipas, all work and services are suspended from 11:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., with the exception of pharmacies, medical units, and hospitals.  Within these municipalities, the circulation of vehicles between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. is only permitted for travel to pharmacies, health care facilities, social assistance institutions, public security institutions, and institutions considered essential for the protection of individuals or property.

As of early January, only Avianca Airlines (AV) and Conviasa Airlines (V0), as well as some charter services, are offering flights to and from Nicaragua.    Augusto C. Sandino International Airport (MGA) in Managua remains open, and domestic flights and cargo transportation continue to operate. All travelers arriving in Nicaragua must present a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. Nonresident foreign nationals showing symptoms of the disease will not be permitted to enter, while citizens and legal residents who show symptoms are required to self-quarantine.    The government has not officially announced any closures of its land and sea ports of entry or any significant restrictions on domestic movements and business operations. However, some sea vessels have been denied entry. Disruptions to travel at land, sea, and air ports of entry will likely persist despite the borders being opened. Heightened screening measures at the land borders could cause some delays to cargo transportation and other cross-border travel. All measures are subject to amendment at short notice.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210111125842/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/424971/nicaragua-airlines-to-suspend-international-passenger-flights-through-february-update-8"
