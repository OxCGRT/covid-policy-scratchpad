There are health and safety risks, an entry ban and / or quarantine obligation.” Code yellow is defined as “You can travel, but be vigilant, there are risks.”.

The Government of Barbados have boosted priority capital spending and introduced social programs for displaced workers to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. This included infrastructure investment to renovate schools, government buildings and industrial complexes, as well as introduced a Household Survival Program. The latter involves a minimum income for households made unemployed by COVID-19 and supplemental unemployment benefits though the National Insurance Scheme.     https://web.archive.org/web/20201129213032/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#B last updated November 19 2020"

Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September). Banks are now working with individual borrowers as needed on further repayment extensions.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20201129213032/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#B"
