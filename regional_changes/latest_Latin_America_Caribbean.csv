Paraguay recognises as final the second dose in a two-dose vaccination scheme or a single dose in a single-dose vaccination scheme.    All travellers aged 12 years and older â regardless of vaccination status â are also required to show a negative COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 48 hours before travel, or a negative antigen test taken up to 24 hours before travel.    All travellers must present evidence of international health insurance, that includes COVID-19 coverage and undertake a COVID-19 PCR test on the 5th day after the pre-travel test â if still in Paraguay at that date. If the test comes back positive, the traveller will have to isolate for 7 days.    Travellers who do not have a full vaccination scheme may be refused entry and deported unless they fall into the listed specific categories: Foreign nationals with residency in Paraguay who are not vaccinated or have an incomplete vaccination scheme: Humanitarian reasons for unvaccinated non-resident foreigners; Foreign investors, entrepreneurs and specialised technicians who need to enter the country for a maximum stay of up to 7 days.      /web/20220325132531/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/entry-requirements    /web/20220325125144/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/coronavirus"
