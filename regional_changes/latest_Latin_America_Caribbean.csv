We recommend that you contact local/state authorities for more information. Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free. Some states do free, drive-through testing, but this tends to be arranged ahead of time via appointment. There is also information on testing sites and procedures available through the official app of the Ministry of Health.     https://archive.fo/L33N3"
