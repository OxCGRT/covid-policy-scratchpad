Regarding the consequences for workers who refuse to be vaccinated:  If the unvaccinated worker can perform remote work, they must provide services under this modality, without affecting their employment relationship.  When remote work is not possible due to the nature of their activities, the employer may suspend the payment of remuneration. If the parties so agree, a paid leave may be agreed upon.  Exceptions may be made by the Ministry of Labor at a later date.  There is no regulation on the possibility of sanctioning staff who do not wish to be vaccinated."

Paraguay recognises as final the second dose in a two-dose vaccination scheme or a single dose in a single-dose vaccination scheme.    All travellers aged 12 years and older â regardless of vaccination status â are also required to show a negative COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 48 hours before travel, or a negative antigen test taken up to 24 hours before travel.    All travellers must present evidence of international health insurance, that includes COVID-19 coverage and undertake a COVID-19 PCR test on the 5th day after the pre-travel test â if still in Paraguay at that date. If the test comes back positive, the traveller will have to isolate for 7 days.    Travellers who do not have a full vaccination scheme may be refused entry and deported unless they fall into the listed specific categories: Foreign nationals with residency in Paraguay who are not vaccinated or have an incomplete vaccination scheme: Humanitarian reasons for unvaccinated non-resident foreigners; Foreign investors, entrepreneurs and specialised technicians who need to enter the country for a maximum stay of up to 7 days.      /web/20220325132531/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/entry-requirements    /web/20220325125144/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/coronavirus"
