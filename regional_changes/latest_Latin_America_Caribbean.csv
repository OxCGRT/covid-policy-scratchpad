The measures will be applied to Cuban travelers who arrive in the country through the airports of the tourist poles of Varadero (Juan Gualberto GÃ³mez International Airport) and Cayo Coco (Jardines del Rey International Airport), maintaining the arrival of foreign tourists through those airports, without affecting the operation of the JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport in Havana and the Antonio Maceo International Airport in Santiago de Cuba.      Main measures:    The mandatory isolation of 14 nights in hotel facilities is established for 100% of Cuban travelers who arrive at the airports of Varadero and Cayo Coco.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210813091108/https://salud.msp.gob.cu/nuevas-medidas-de-control-sanitario-internacional/"
