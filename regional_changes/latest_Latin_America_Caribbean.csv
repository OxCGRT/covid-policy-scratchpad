Fully vaccinated travelers arriving from these areas may provide proof of full vaccination in lieu of a negative test result. This measure also applies to those with travel histories in the aforementioned countries during the 14-day period prior to their arrival in the Dominican Republic.    Authorities do not require arrivals from other locations to present a negative test result. Nevertheless, some travelers arriving by air are randomly selected for rapid testing upon arrival at the airport; persons testing positive will be required to enter quarantine. Individuals who present a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival or proof of full vaccination are exempt from random testing.    All travelers must also complete an entry and exit (e-Ticket) form, which combines the traveler's Health Affidavit, Customs Declaration, and International Embarkation/Disembarkation forms. The entry and exit form can be completed up to 72 hours before arrival or departure.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211126142326/https://crisis24.garda.com/insights-intelligence/intelligence/risk-alerts/wip10011872746/dominican-republic-covid-19-international-travel-and-domestic-restrictions-remain-unchanged-as-of-nov-11-as-compared-with-those-in-effect-in-mid-october-update-45  https://web.archive.org/web/20211126142422/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/dominican-republic/entry-requirements"
