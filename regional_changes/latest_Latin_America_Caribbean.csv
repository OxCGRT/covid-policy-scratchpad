There are health and safety risks, an entry ban and / or quarantine obligation.” Code yellow is defined as “You can travel, but be vigilant, there are risks.”. The Dutch code yellow classification does not mean that people from the Netherlands do not need to provide proof of a negative test or take a test on arrival – testing remains a requirement by Aruba for entry. https://web.archive.org/web/20201122123113/https:/www.visitaruba.com/news/general/corona-virus-and-travel-to-aruba/"

Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September).
