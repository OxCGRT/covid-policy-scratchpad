PCR, serology-based antibody tests, and antigen tests are available. Turn-around time varies widely depending upon location.  Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test. Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo and GaleÃ£o International Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Testing is available in the private sector without a doctorâs prescription, but a prescription may be required for insurance payment.   In the public healthcare system, each Brazilian state has its own COVID-19 testing plan. We recommend that you contact local/state authorities for more information. Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free.

Students of grade 4 will attend face to face sessions on Fridays only.

At the secondary level, students from each form will attend face to face sessions on one day per week from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm.
