This is welcome news as it should provide a welcome boost to tourism from the Netherlands. Charter company TUI had previously indicated that they would resume flights as soon as Aruba is back to code yellow. Code orange is defined as “Only travel if you have to. There are health and safety risks, an entry ban and / or quarantine obligation.” Code yellow is defined as “You can travel, but be vigilant, there are risks.”. The Dutch code yellow classification does not mean that people from the Netherlands do not need to provide proof of a negative test or take a test on arrival – testing remains a requirement by Aruba for entry. https://web.archive.org/web/20201122123113/https:/www.visitaruba.com/news/general/corona-virus-and-travel-to-aruba/"

Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September).

""After the concerns expressed by some sectors of society, we have deemed it pertinent to make the following clarifications regarding the new social distancing measures adopted by the Government this December 15 through Decree 698-20,"" said Germán.      Here are the details:    ""Now we have two different hours for the curfew, depending on the locality. On the one hand, in the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo, Santiago, Duarte, La Vega and Puerto Plata this applies every day from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am ”, explained Germán.      While, in the rest of the country, the curfew applies from Monday to Friday from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. and Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.     The spokesperson for the Presidency clarified the limitations of the new measures in relation to transfer to homes. “At these times that we have indicated, all curfew restrictions begin to apply, including the closure of public spaces, with the only exception that those days and places in which the curfew begins at 7: 00 pm, a two-hour grace period has been granted, that is, until 9:00 pm with the exclusive purpose that people can move quietly home, without the anguish that they will be detained for reasons beyond their control, such as the traffic jams that usually take place in hours close to curfew ”.    He added: “Regarding the gathering of people, it has been prohibited for more than 10 people to gather in public and private spaces for public use. This means that in these spaces more than 10 people can coincide at the same time, but they cannot gather in groups larger than that amount, as would happen in a shopping plaza, a transport station or a park ”.    The same restriction applies to establishments such as restaurants and bars, where tables cannot be occupied by more than 10 people and always respecting the sanitary protocols of the sector, such as not exceeding 70% of the total capacity of the premises.      “Finally, we wish to highlight that all the traffic exceptions during the curfew hours that we had previously, such as those relating to doctors and nurses and other health personnel, the one relating to international passengers heading or they return from the airport or the operators of vehicles dedicated to the distribution of food, supplies, fuels and other essential products, among other cases that can be detailed in article 4 of Decree 698-20, ""he said.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201221140355/https://presidencia.gob.do/noticias/la-portavoz-de-la-presidencia-detalla-el-alcance-de-las-medidas-del-toque-de-queda"
