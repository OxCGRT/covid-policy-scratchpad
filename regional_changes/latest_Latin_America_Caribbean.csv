However, as the spread of COVID-19 was much lower than expected, the authorities spent less on COVID-related needs than anticipated. Of the HTG 18.2 billion (1.3 percent of revised GDP) allocated in April for COVID-related spending, actual expenditures amounted to HTG 8.4 Bn (0.6 percent of GDP). Most of this (HTG 5.6 billion) was dedicated to health, while transfers to households, businesses and schools were trimmed to HTG 2.3 billion from HTG 8.3 billion.  https://archive.fo/4yJE8"
