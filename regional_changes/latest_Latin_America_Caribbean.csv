In the private healthcare system, there are many labs that perform COVID-19 testing.  Prices vary, but COVID-19 tests typically cost between $20 and $100.  PCR, serology-based antibody tests, and antigen tests are available. Turn-around time varies widely depending upon location.  Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test. Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo and GaleÃ£o International Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Testing is available in the private sector without a doctorâs prescription, but a prescription may be required for insurance payment.   In the public healthcare system, each Brazilian state has its own COVID-19 testing plan. We recommend that you contact local/state authorities for more information. Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free. Some states do free, drive-through testing, but this tends to be arranged ahead of time via appointment. There is also information on testing sites and procedures available through the official app of the Ministry of Health.     http://web.archive.org/web/20220625193817/https://br.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
