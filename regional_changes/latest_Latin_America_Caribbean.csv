The resumption of face to face classes was announced by Minister for Education, Human Resource Planning, Vocational Training and National Excellence, Hon. Octavia Alfred at a press conference on Friday March 4. According to her, Cabinet has decided that all primary and secondary schools will be open for in-person learning from Monday 7th March 2022, utilizing a blended approach, that is online and face to face. The general arrangement is that all form five and all Grade 6 students at all schools will be in daily, and the rest of the space at the schools will be used to rotate the rest of the school population. Small schools with a population of eighty students or less with adequate space for the stipulated 3 to 6 feet social distancing will be fully open. We have about four schools with less than 81 students but they do not have the required space so they will fall under the arrangement for schools with a population between 81 and 200 students. These schools will operate under a blended approach with grade six students coming in every day, while Grades K, 1, 2 and 3 come in from Mondays to Wednesdays, and Grades 4 and 5 on Thursdays and Fridays. All primary schools will operate from 9 to 2, however the primary schools who operate from 8 to 1 will continue to do so. At secondary schools all Form 5 students will be in Monday to Friday from 8 to 1. Forms 3 and 4 will go in Mondays to Wednesday forms 1 and 2 students will attend Thursdays and Fridays. The Dominica Grammar School and the Goodwill Secondary School will continue to work on shift. The Dominica Community High School has just 61 students and enough space to accommodate all the students every day. The days when children are not engaged online they will be doing face to face and the days when they are not at school they will be engaged online.
