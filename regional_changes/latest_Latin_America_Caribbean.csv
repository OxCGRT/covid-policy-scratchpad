What conditions must the beneficiaries meet?  This subsidy corresponds to dependent workers who are in a situation of partial suspension of activities and within the framework of Law 19,972 and MTSS resolution No. 208 , of August 31, 2021.    Monthly workers, day laborers and with mixed remuneration who have a reduction of at least six full days of work and a maximum of 19 in the month or the reduction of the working day of at least 50% of the usual schedule will be entitled to the subsidy. Also, piecework workers or those with commission-type remuneration with a partial reduction of 50% or more in their average income (of the immediately preceding six months).    The reduction must occur during the validity of the ministerial resolutions, protection is currently foreseen until June 30, 2022.    Right to receive  The method of calculation that applies from September 2020 is described below.    Monthly and mixed-paid workers  The subsidy to be received will be up to 25% of the monthly average of the computable nominal remuneration received in the six full months of effective work prior to the cause being configured, depending on the number of days of suspension or reduction.    As of the month of April, the amount to be received, which includes the subsidy and what is paid by the company for the period actually worked, will in no case be less than 75% of the average monthly remuneration of the last six months taken for the benefit calculation.     day laborers  The subsidy to be received will be an average wage for each day not worked. The average wage is calculated by dividing by 150 the total remuneration received in the last six full months of effective work.    In all cases, the amount to be received will not exceed 12 wages and the wages worked plus the wages in subsidy will not exceed the monthly average of the last six months taken to calculate the benefit.    Pieceworkers and commission-type remuneration   The subsidy to be received will be the equivalent of the difference between 75% of the monthly average of the last six full months of effective work and that paid by the employer in said period, which may not be less than 25% of the monthly average.      To take into account:  in all cases, the employer will pay for what was actually worked.    Limits for the payment of the subsidy  Maximum cap: $50,973.34 (January 2022).    Minimum cap: $6,369.95 (January 2022).    https://web.archive.org/web/20220718125102/https://www.bps.gub.uy/16874/subsidio-especial-por-desempleo-parcial.html"
