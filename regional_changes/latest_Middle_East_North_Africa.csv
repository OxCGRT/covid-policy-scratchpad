In the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Epidemic Control (ACEC) that has just been concluded, the ACEC's members have reached the following:          1.    Recommend the use of masks indoors, especially in gatherings.   2.    An additional (fifth) dose of the vaccine for COVID-19 is not recommended at the present time. However, it was decided to continue the discussion on this matter later in light of infection rates. However, it is important that individuals who are eligible for vaccination with the fourth vaccine dose and who have not been vaccinated yet complete the full vaccination schedule.   3.    The basic vaccine schedule has two doses + booster. It was decided to enable children 5 years old and older to receive a booster shot.   4.    Most ACEC members have recommended that the vaccine for COVID-19 (2 doses + booster)  be mandatory for healthcare workers.   The ACEC's recommendations will be presented to the Ministry of Health Director General for a final decision.

""Recently there has been a steep increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel, which has lead to increase in the number of serious cases. We want to maintain the daily life routine â but also stay healthy.    ""The shops and malls are open without restrictions in order for us to be able to carry on with our daily routine carefree, so now all of us share the responsibility for our health and the health of others.    ""We ask you to wear masks in indoor settings, not because it is mandatory â but because it is an act of solidarity.    ""Wearing a mask is not a burden; discomfort is marginal, and helps to overcome the current surge with a minimum number of cases of serious illness and fatalities. We all need to be carefulâtake care of ourselves and the next person.     ""Multiple studies worldwide have shown that wearing face masks indoors significantly reduces the risk of infecting others with COVID-19. It is very important to fit the mask to the face (it must completely cover the mouth and nose, be snug on your face; do not take it off in indoor settings).    ""Although some try to make others doubt the effectiveness of masks, the scientific information concerning their effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19 to others is well-founded and well-established!     ""Many studies have shown that wearing masks in public settings significantly reduces the community spread of COVID-19, too.    ""A study of the American Centers for Disease Control found that those who wear a mask in indoor settings are more protected from infection, and that consistent use of masks reduces the risk of infection by almost 50%.""

In the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Epidemic Control (ACEC) that has just been concluded , the ACEC's members have reached the following:          1.    Recommend the use of masks indoors, especially in gatherings.   2.    An additional (fifth) dose of the vaccine for COVID-19 is not recommended at the present time. However, it was decided to continue the discussion on this matter later in light of infection rates. However, it is important that individuals who are eligible for vaccination with the fourth vaccine dose and who have not been vaccinated yet complete the full vaccination schedule.   3.    The basic vaccine schedule has two doses + booster. It was decided to enable children 5 years old and older to receive a booster shot.   4.    Most ACEC members have recommended that the vaccine for COVID-19 (2 doses + booster)  be mandatory for healthcare workers.   The ACEC's recommendations will be presented to the Ministry of Health Director General for a final decision.    Source: https://archive.ph/LFY38 [Ministry of Health press release]"
