Many schools in the UAE have issued renewed advisories cautioning parents and their wards to take all precautionary measures for Covid-19.  This word of caution comes after the countryâs coronavirus cases crossed the 1,000 mark, in a four-month high, on Thursday.      Additionally, institutions have been receiving updated notifications from the Covid Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (CMEC) in private schools and nurseries stipulating guidelines for exam related procedures in case children contract Covid during the ongoing board exams.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220613155106/https://www.khaleejtimes.com/schooling-in-uae/rising-covid-cases-in-uae-schools-issue-fresh-advisories-to-parents-students"

This rule applies to UAE nationals, residents and tourists.      Travellers must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival in Dubai (only if requested) and quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. Passengers who test positive must follow the guidelines issued by Dubai Health Authority.    Passengers arriving in Sharjah must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival.  They must quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. If the result is positive, then the protocols of the UAEâs Ministry of Health and Prevention will apply.    Violating home quarantine procedures would amount to endangering the lives of others and makes the offender liable to a fine of AED 50,000.      https://web.archive.org/web/20220613162351/https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/handling-the-covid-19-outbreak/travelling-amid-covid-19/quarantine-guidelines-for-travellers-to-the-uae"
