The Ministry of Education and the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority said school field trips could also be organised as part of the measures.  Both vaccinated and unvaccinated pupils and staff will be able to take part in such trips, providing they have green status on Al Hosn app.  Face masks must be worn in closed spaces and on buses for trips.  Parents can attend the restored events and activities in line with precautionary measures, including wearing face masks in closed spaces and following the Green Pass protocols on Al Hosn app.  ""The updated protocol also requires all university students wishing to enter dorms to conduct a PCR test once every month, or to follow the Green Pass Protocol for vaccinated and unvaccinated students,"" news agency Wam reported.  Under the updates, following the Green Pass Protocol will be mandatory for all visitors of educational establishments, along with pupils aged 16 and above, educational staff and personnel.
