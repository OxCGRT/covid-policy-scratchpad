Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.    I recorded this as a 1(narrow) because it includes only tax exemption and nothing else like utilities    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20210215151708/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Progress has been made in expanding the number of peripheral laboratories that are now able to test for COVID-19, and consideration will be made in engaging overall laboratory capacities. Across the country, 17 laboratories now have the capacity to test cases. An additional four will be added soon and university laboratories will also be engaged. With support from WHO and other partners, Egypt now has the capacity to conduct up to 200,000 tests.    Egypt’s strong disease surveillance system and contact tracing efforts have proven effective in controlling managing sporadic and clusters of cases before they can spread. Recent border closures now provide an opportunity to enhance screening and rapid testing capacity using a risk assessment approach.    Maintaining effective contact tracing with proper quarantine mechanisms, as well as continuing systematic testing of patients seeking treatment for all acute respiratory infections will ensure that no critical COVID-19 cases are missed.    Building on the current well-structured Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programme, WHO will work with national health authorities to enhance the isolation, quarantine and referral mechanisms, and scale up IPC practices to prevent transmission at all levels to ensure that patients and health workers are protected.

Last month, the country’s Education Ministry announced increasing the average attendance rate at all public and private schools as well as kindergartens to reach 50 per cent of their overall capacity in the second semester during which students are divided into two groups for alternate attendance. According to the arrangement, 50 per cent of the students at each school attend the class for one week and get access to distance schooling the following week.    An education system blending class attendance and online learning will continue to be applied alternately. Text messages have been sent to parents including health directives, school schedules and timetables for online learning, Al Sharq newspaper reported today, quoting school officials. As part of precautions against the virus, students attending classes are required to wear protective face masks, and observe distancing of at least 1.5 metres between each other while more gates are designated for school entry to avoid crowding.   /web/20210209123958/https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/qatar/covid-19-students-partially-return-to-schools-in-qatar-1.76245331"
