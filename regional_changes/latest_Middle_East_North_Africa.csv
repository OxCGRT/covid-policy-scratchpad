Oman,OMN,10-May-21,C1: School closing,"Muscat: The new academic year with a mix of classroom and online learning will begin for the students of government and private schools in Oman on Sunday amid the coronavirus pandemic.    The Ministry of Education (MoE) is taking all steps to guarantee the safety of students, teachers, and other staff.    It is expected that around 676,943 students including 334, 889 girls will take part in the blended education under the guidance of 56,613 teachers even as the nation continues to battle the COVID-19 that delayed the start of the academic year by nearly two months.    The Supreme Committee had announced that the school year will begin on November 1 and also endorsed the blended learning.    According to Abdullah al Busaidy, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Education, “The ministry continues to work with telecommunications companies to provide Internet packages for schools. He said that school hours for students in Grades 1-4 will be between 11 am and 2 pm, Grades 5-11 between 8 am and 11 am, and for Grade-12, between 8 am and 2 pm.    Oman TV will telecast lessons for Grade 12 daily on weekdays between 2:30 pm to 6:30 pm. Schedules for school classes on TV are available at the ministry website.    It is estimated that around 82 per cent of schools will implement an e-learning system, while 10 per cent will follow blended education, and the rest will have full attendance in schools.    If the parents prefer to educate their children (Grades 1 to 12) completely through the distance education system due to safety concerns, they have to submit a written application to the school.  http://web.archive.org/web/20210510223007/https://www.omanobserver.om/article/10096/Main/schools-begin-offline-online-in-oman",Middle_East_North_Africa,2G,2G

The system is available in English, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi and Bengali. Tarassud Plus offers patients access to medical hotlines and support staff who direct them to facilities where they can be treated for their reported symptoms. Once patients are diagnosed, a medical tracking bracelet connected to the application ensures that they stay at home for the duration of their quarantine or isolation. In the future, coronavirus positive patients may be prevented from entering crowded areas like markets. The epidemiological data collected via Tarassud Plus (monitored through a round-the-clock Center of Operation Management in the capital of Muscat) helps medical officials track the spread of the virus and risk-stratify suspected cases.’  https://web.archive.org/web/20210323092622/https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/oman-launches-technological-surveillance-system-to-track-covid-19",Middle_East_North_Africa,1,1
