In early August, the Israel Defense Forces was formally tasked with “cutting the chain of infections” for the country — finding and testing those suspected of having contracted the disease and putting them into quarantine. This included taking responsibility for the country’s testing efforts and conducting epidemiological surveys: the practice of speaking with confirmed carriers to retrace their steps in the days following their infection to identify and warn those they may have unwittingly passed the disease on to.  Public health experts have identified this type of contact tracing as crucial in curbing the spread of the virus, as it allows authorities to locate people who may have contracted the disease before they have a chance to pass it on.

The plan also includes an expansion of the budget allocation for health expenses and the creation of a TND 100 million fund for public hospitals to purchase equipment. On the social side, the package included cash transfers for low income households and for disabled and homeless people (TND 450 million for three months).
