This fund covers the costs of upgrading medical facilities and support businesses and households impacted by the pandemic. Businesses with less than 500 employees made temporarily idle and experiencing a reduction in turnover of more than 50 percent were authorized to defer social contribution payments until June 30. Their employees who become temporarily unemployed and are registered with the pension fund received 2,000 dirhams a month and were allowed put off debt payments until June 30. In April, 2020 almost 1 million workers from 134,000 companies were eligible to these transfers. Companies and households can also defer income tax payment until September 30, 2020. In addition, the government has decided to accelerate payment to its suppliers to support businesses. The government has extended social transfers to employees temporarily unemployed and further deferred social contribution payments for some sectors (including tourism) until end-March 2021.    The government also took measures to support households working in the informal sector. Householdsâ benefiting from the non-contributory health insurance (RAMED) received a monthly mobile payment of DRH 800-1200 (USD 80-120) from April, depending on householdsâ composition. Other households which do not benefit from RAMED can claim cash support by registering online. In April, 85 percent of eligible households in the informal sectoral were covered. The government postponed the deadline for personal income tax filing from end-April to end-June 2020 and provided a tax exemption for additional compensation paid by firms to employees in the formal sector up to a limit of 50 percent of the average monthly net salary. A decree-law adopted on April 6, 2020 authorizes the government to increase external borrowing beyond the ceiling approved in the 2020 Budget Act.    On August 6,2020 the authorities announced a plan to sustain the economic recovery and employment levels. The plan envisages the mobilization of DRH 120 billion, mainly in the form of credit guarantees to firms and funding for a newly -created âFund for Strategic Investmentâ, which will finance investment projects (including PPPs) and sustain the capital of firms that needs equity injections to develop their business.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211022120614/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#M"
