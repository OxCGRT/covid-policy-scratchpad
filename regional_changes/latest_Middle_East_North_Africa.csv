Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.    I recorded this as a 1(narrow) because it includes only tax exemption and nothing else like utilities    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20210215151708/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

On 15 February, the MoH announced that it had to delay a broader rollout of the vaccination campaign, due to delays in anticipated deliveries.    In Gaza, the first batch of vaccines, 2,000 doses of Sputnik V, arrived on 17 February; an additional 20,000 does of Sputnik V were delivered on 21 February, as a donation from the United Arab Emirates. The vaccination campaign in Gaza began on 22 February, targeting frontline health workers.    The first vaccines delivered through the Gavi COVAX AMC Facility, in partnership with WHO and UNICEF, are now expected to arrive in March, including 37,400 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, subject to agreement with the manufacturers. A further allocation of 240,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine are also expected, probably in June.    Through COVAX, the Palestinian Authority PA is eligible to receive donor funded COVID-19 vaccines for up to 20 percent of its population and has applied for additional doses to cover an additional 40 per cent of the population on a self-financing basis. According to the World Bank(link is external), about US$55 million will be needed to vaccinate 60 per cent of Palestinians, of which there is an existing gap of $30 million.    Israel is continuing its vaccination programme, which is also available to Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and currently ranks first globally for per capita vaccinations(link is external), with over three and a half million people already vaccinated with the first dose. On 23 February, Israel opened a vaccination centre at Qalandiya checkpoint for Palestinians with Israeli residency (from East Jerusalem) who live beyond the Barrier, and who face problems in accessing the remainder of Jerusalem city.    On 28 February, the Israeli government approved a plan to vaccinate over 120,000 Palestinians without Israeli residency, who are employed in Israel or in Israeli settlements, to be implemented at border crossings and in industrial zones across the West Bank. A number of Israeli, Palestinian and international health and human rights organizations, as well as Israeli health officials, have called on(link is external) the Israeli authorities to ensure that vaccines are equally and fairly provided to Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.    https://archive.vn/HQxN3"

To ensure survival, families have been sharing responsibility amongst their members for providing for their household.    Seeking to empower displaced women with the ability to earn an income, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) partnered with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to launch a facemask-making project in 35 displacement sites across Ibb and Marib governorates.    “We received a lot of requests from displaced women asking for support to start small projects,” explained Sabah Al Qubati, a member of IOM’s Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) team in Marib. “IOM responded to the call and taught them how to make masks, helping them earn an income while preventing the spread of COVID-19.”    Around 45 women in Ibb and 60 women in Marib took part in this IOM-KSA initiative. The women received training, as well as the tools and materials to make the masks.   /web/20210301235106/https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/how-sewing-face-masks-helping-displaced-women-yemen"
