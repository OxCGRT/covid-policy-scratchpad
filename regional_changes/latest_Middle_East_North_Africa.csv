""Recently there has been a steep increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel, which has lead to increase in the number of serious cases. We want to maintain the daily life routine â but also stay healthy.    ""The shops and malls are open without restrictions in order for us to be able to carry on with our daily routine carefree, so now all of us share the responsibility for our health and the health of others.    ""We ask you to wear masks in indoor settings, not because it is mandatory â but because it is an act of solidarity.    ""Wearing a mask is not a burden; discomfort is marginal, and helps to overcome the current surge with a minimum number of cases of serious illness and fatalities. We all need to be carefulâtake care of ourselves and the next person.     ""Multiple studies worldwide have shown that wearing face masks indoors significantly reduces the risk of infecting others with COVID-19. It is very important to fit the mask to the face (it must completely cover the mouth and nose, be snug on your face; do not take it off in indoor settings).    ""Although some try to make others doubt the effectiveness of masks, the scientific information concerning their effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19 to others is well-founded and well-established!     ""Many studies have shown that wearing masks in public settings significantly reduces the community spread of COVID-19, too.    ""A study of the American Centers for Disease Control found that those who wear a mask in indoor settings are more protected from infection, and that consistent use of masks reduces the risk of infection by almost 50%.""

This was previously coded as ""2G - Required Closing (some levels)"" due to teacher strikes following the reopening in early January, which meant most schools did not reopen as planned. However, Reliefweb is now reporting that the opening has to some degree taken place, therefore, the coding has been changed to ""0 - No Measures"" in line with the official policy that schools are open.   ""In Lebanon, school reopening was less of a marked event, in part due to teacher strikes and the slow reopening of schools for refugee children. Older students who had not progressed were also more hesitant to return as they were one to two years beyond the age they should be for their grade level. When schools reopened, families were facing far more extreme financial hardship thanbefore schools closed. This was evident in return to school patterns.""  https://archive.ph/QIp6f"
