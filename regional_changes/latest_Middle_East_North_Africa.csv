United Arab Emirates,ARE,2021-03-21,H7: Vaccination policy,"ABU DHABI, 20th March, 2021 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Health and Prevention has urged all Emiratis and residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccination to start booking appointments for inoculation starting Sunday, March 21, now that the six-week priority entitlement given to people who are most at risk of infection is over.    Those eligible for vaccination, including citizens and residents aged 16 and above, can now get inoculated for free in any of the 205 vaccination locations available nationwide, the ministry said in a statement tonight.    The statement said it's incumbent on those opting for vaccination to get prior booking as those who are most vulnerable to infection will continue to be received by vaccination centres without prior booking.    The past six weeks saw a collaborative effort made by all health departments to prioritise those most at risk of infection, including the elderly and people with chronic diseases, such as heart, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses.    In the meantime, Dr. Abdul Rahman bin Mohammad bin Nasser Al Owais, Minister of Health and Prevention, said Saturday that 72.89 percent of elderly Emiratis and residents and those with chronic diseases have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and that 56.59 percent of the eligible population have been inoculated against the disease.    In line with the Ministry's plans as well as the objectives of the National COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, to ensure acquired community immunity, the Ministry has urged all the eligible population to get vaccinated and to encourage their family members, friends and colleagues to follow suit for their common good.    The UAE has approved four Covid vaccines for emergency uses: Sinopharm; Pfizer-BioNTech; Sputnik V; and Oxford-AstraZeneca. In addition, MoHAP is constantly working to get the entire UAE population vaccinated as soon as possible.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210322152304/http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302920029",Middle_East_North_Africa,4G,4G

Yemen,YEM,2021-03-02,H1: Public information campaigns,"Predictably, the war decimated the country’s health sector, with at least half the medical facilities rendered dysfunctional while confronting the worst cholera outbreak in modern times with 110,000 cases in April. Around 20 percent of the country’s 333 districts have no medical doctors and the numbers are getting thinner as the war and now the pandemic force doctors and other medical staff to leave the country or avoid working for fear of infection with little available protection. The country currently has only 500 ventilators (60 for children) and 700 intensive care unit beds. According to the U.N. more than 30 of 41 major U.N. programs in Yemen will close in the next few weeks if additional funding is not available. Some 10,000 health care workers have already lost the United Nations payments that for many were their only salary. The U.N. has also had to halt health services for women giving birth in 150 hospitals. As the UNHCR says. the country’s health system “has in effect collapsed.”  But the U.N., Doctors without Borders, and others believe this to be a dramatic undercount given limited testing ability. As of May 30, 2020, only 2,678 people had been tested out of 28 million Yemenis. The U.N. and other aid agencies are operating on the basis that “community transmission”—meaning widespread, unchecked, and uncontrolled transmission—is taking place across the country.   /web/20210308222208/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/06/15/yemen-and-covid-19-the-pandemic-exacts-its-devastating-toll/",Middle_East_North_Africa,1G,1G

Yemen,YEM,2021-03-02,H6: Facial Coverings,"After COVID-19 broke out in the conflict-stricken country, job opportunities—particularly casual labour—began disappearing. To ensure survival, families have been sharing responsibility amongst their members for providing for their household.    Seeking to empower displaced women with the ability to earn an income, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) partnered with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to launch a facemask-making project in 35 displacement sites across Ibb and Marib governorates.    “We received a lot of requests from displaced women asking for support to start small projects,” explained Sabah Al Qubati, a member of IOM’s Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) team in Marib. “IOM responded to the call and taught them how to make masks, helping them earn an income while preventing the spread of COVID-19.”    Around 45 women in Ibb and 60 women in Marib took part in this IOM-KSA initiative. The women received training, as well as the tools and materials to make the masks.   /web/20210308222503/https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/how-sewing-face-masks-helping-displaced-women-yemen",Middle_East_North_Africa,1G,1G

Yemen,YEM,2021-03-02,H8: Protection of elderly people,"Although most shielding at the time of writing has occurred in high-income countries,5–7 early evidence has begun to emerge from LMICs. Cases are presented below, based on acceptability studies from Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Northwest Syria, and implementation evidence from parts of India, Yemen, and Ethiopia. There are significant practical obstacles to shielding in LMICs, where material and social support may be lacking or where households are large but housing space is limited.  /web/20210308222647/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SSHAP%20Key%20Considerations_Emerging%20Evidence%20on%20Shielding%20Vulnerable%20Groups.pdf  While it’s possible that environmental stressors make Yemen’s population more vulnerable to COVID-19, doctors suspect the high death rate means many more people in Aden—particularly the elderly—are dying at home without seeking treatment.   /web/20210308222805/https://time.com/5843732/yemen-covid19-invisible-crisis/",Middle_East_North_Africa,0,0
