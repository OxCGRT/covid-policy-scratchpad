""Wearing a mask is not a burden; discomfort is marginal, and helps to overcome the current surge with a minimum number of cases of serious illness and fatalities. We all need to be carefulâtake care of ourselves and the next person.     ""Multiple studies worldwide have shown that wearing face masks indoors significantly reduces the risk of infecting others with COVID-19. It is very important to fit the mask to the face (it must completely cover the mouth and nose, be snug on your face; do not take it off in indoor settings).    ""Although some try to make others doubt the effectiveness of masks, the scientific information concerning their effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19 to others is well-founded and well-established!
