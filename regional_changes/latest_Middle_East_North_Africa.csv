Studies and education  Guidelines regarding the education system, classes and children    Checking and learning  The ""examiners and learners"" outline is intended to allow for as continuous a study routine as possible for male and female students. In this framework, all students in kindergartens and first to sixth grades will do two home speed tests, which will be checked twice a week, and if the result is negative and there are no symptoms, they will be able to go to schools and kindergartens and educational institutions. Students in grades 7-12 will not do tests twice a week, but will fill out a form twice a week that they have no symptoms, and will be able to get to school.    For whom the outline is intended  The outline is intended for students up to the age of 18 in these educational institutions: kindergartens, nurseries, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, yeshivas and boarding schools.    How the outline works  Boys and girls in kindergartens and grades one through six - the tests will be done at home on Sundays and Wednesdays in the morning before arrival on the school day, or the evening before the arrival on the school day.    The results of the tests must be reported on the Ministry of Education portal.    â¢	If the result is negative, and there is no fever of 38 degrees or more, cough or difficulty breathing - it is possible to get to school or kindergarten (unless there is a verified person living with them at home).  â¢	If the result is positive - a supervised rapid test should be done.  If the result of the supervised test is negative - it is possible to return to school or kindergarten.  If the supervised test is positive - enter at least 5 days of isolation, and follow the instructions for the verified Corona..    Students in grades 7-12 - there is no need to do home tests as part of the outline. Students will fill out a form on Sunday and Wednesday for no symptoms (fever of 38 degrees or more, cough or difficulty breathing), and no verified person living with them at home - and can come to school.    Pupils in the schools that participate in 'Magen Hinuch' - will only do one quick home test a week, as long as they continue to do a weekly PCR test at school on a regular basis.    Home test kits will be distributed to all male and female students, free of charge.    What to do in case of close contact with verified Corona:  â¢	Pupils in kindergartens and grades one through six who have been in close contact with Verified to Corona and have been checked on Sundays and Wednesdays, and no Verified who lives with them - will no longer have to go into isolation.  â¢	Students in seventh to twelfth grades who have filled out a form stating that they have no symptoms on Sundays and Wednesdays and have no verified person living with them - will not have to go into isolation.  â¢	Pupils in kindergartens and grades one through six, who are not vaccinated or recovering, who have not been tested on Sundays and Wednesdays and whose test results have not been reported on the Ministry of Education portal - will have to go into full isolation in case they are exposed to corona  verification .  â¢	Students in seventh to twelfth grades, unvaccinated and not recovering, who did not fill out the absence of symptoms form on Sunday and Wednesday - will have to go into full isolation in case they are exposed to verification to Corona (  isolation can be shortened from the 5th day).  â¢	In case of direct exposure and close to verified (in class or in the afternoon) - it is recommended to be checked daily for 5 days from the date of exposure.  â¢	If one of the male or female members of the student's household is verified for corona - neither vaccinated nor recovering will enter full isolation (  isolation can be shortened  starting from the 5th day).    Please note: The count of isolation days begins on the last day of contact with the verified person. If there is no separation in the house between the verified person and the other members of the household - the counting of the isolation days will begin from the day the verified person recovers.    What to do if there are symptoms:  â¢	Students who have a fever of 38 degrees or more - will do a PCR test or a supervised rapid test and remain in isolation until a negative result is obtained in this test, or until 48 hours have passed with a fever of less than 37.5 degrees without antipyretics.  â¢	Pupils who have a cough or difficulty breathing - it is recommended that they do a corona test and stay at home and do a home test. Stay home until the symptoms go away.    Those who are exempt from performing the tests  â¢	Recovers - Exempt from performing home tests for 60 days from the date of recovery.  â¢	Special education - Students in special education frameworks are exempt from performing speed tests twice a week.    A student who is in a risk group for a serious illness or one of the members of their nuclear family is in a risk group - will be allowed not to attend school in the coming month.    What about teaching staff  The outline of tests in the education system does not apply to teaching staff. Teaching men and women who have not been vaccinated and have not recovered will continue to undergo a supervised rapid examination twice a week, and in case of close contact with a verified person will enter full isolation (with the possibility of shortening isolation from the 5th day).

Avoid contact with individuals who have COVID-19 symptoms.   Wash your hands with soap and water frequently, and use a hand sanitizer after sneezing or coughing, as well as before cooking or eating food.   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.   Avoid close contact with people who show symptoms.    Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow. Make sure to wash your hands with soap and water for 40 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer instead.   If you have a chronic disease, make sure you take the prescribed medications as scheduled.   Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects at home, either using regular household cleaners, or diluted bleach. Use 250 ml (1 cup) of water  for every 5ml (1 teaspoon) of bleach. Never mix bleach with other chemical products and use it only in well-ventilated areas.   Use mobile applications to order food and medicine.   Use smartphone applications to get your medicine.   Avoid going to mosques.      If an older adult has to leave home, he or she must:   Stay outdoors or in well-ventilated areas;  Keep a safe distance from others (at least 2 meters);  Avoid large groups and crowded areas;  Avoid sharing food and tableware.     Family members and caregivers of older adults must take the following tips into account:   Wash your hands with soap and water for 40 seconds when you are visiting elderly individuals or returning home to them.   Pay more attention to the personal hygiene of your elderly family members.   Do not share food or tableware with elderly people.   Ensure that the rooms where older people are staying are kept clean and well ventilated.   Call 937 if you notice an elderly having respiratory symptoms, regardless of their severity.   Refrain from coming into close contact with the elderly if you feel sick and seek proper health care.   Refrain from having close physical contact with the elderly for 14 days if you have just returned from abroad.     https://web.archive.org/web/20220123080239/https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/EducationalContent/Health-of-Older-Persons/Pages/008.aspx"
