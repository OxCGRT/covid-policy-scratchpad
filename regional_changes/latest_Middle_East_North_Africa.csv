""Recently there has been a steep increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel, which has lead to increase in the number of serious cases. We want to maintain the daily life routine â but also stay healthy.    ""The shops and malls are open without restrictions in order for us to be able to carry on with our daily routine carefree, so now all of us share the responsibility for our health and the health of others.    ""We ask you to wear masks in indoor settings, not because it is mandatory â but because it is an act of solidarity.    ""Wearing a mask is not a burden; discomfort is marginal, and helps to overcome the current surge with a minimum number of cases of serious illness and fatalities. We all need to be carefulâtake care of ourselves and the next person.     ""Multiple studies worldwide have shown that wearing face masks indoors significantly reduces the risk of infecting others with COVID-19. It is very important to fit the mask to the face (it must completely cover the mouth and nose, be snug on your face; do not take it off in indoor settings).    ""Although some try to make others doubt the effectiveness of masks, the scientific information concerning their effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19 to others is well-founded and well-established!     ""Many studies have shown that wearing masks in public settings significantly reduces the community spread of COVID-19, too.
