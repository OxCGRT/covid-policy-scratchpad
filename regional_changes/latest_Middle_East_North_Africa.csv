Louzir told Tunis Afrique Presse that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be allocated to those suffering from chronic diseases, the elderly, and health workers, adding that the vaccination will not be mandatory.    The health official affirmed that his country has already reserved 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer.    The Tunisian Ministry of Health has signed an agreement to obtain the above-mentioned vaccines at a price of seven U.S. dollars per dose.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210111103217/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-12/16/c_139592399.htm    https://archive.vn/wip/c9LXn"
