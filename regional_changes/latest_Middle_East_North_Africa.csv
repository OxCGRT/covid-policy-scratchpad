Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.    I recorded this as a 1(narrow) because it includes only tax exemption and nothing else like utilities    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20210215151708/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

""The success rate on the national registration platform is rapidly rising and adjusted according to the need, such as rounding up the appointments of people who are immediately following their appointments to those who may miss the vaccination, which will ensure that no vaccine dose is  lost.""  ""The bumps we experienced in the face of the pandemic were very difficult, especially the epidemic, which resulted from the easing of the holidays and the repercussions of the port explosion,"" Hassan told Al-Mayadeen tv, marking the one-year anniversary of the Corona virus  outbreak. ""The vaccine has provided an additional factor that works in response to the epidemic in addition to preventive behaviour,"" he said.  ""In the coming period, there will be multiple vaccines, which will be free for the Lebanese,"" he said, stressing the adoption of the principles of justice and transparency.  ""Lebanon will receive 250,000 Pfizer vaccines by the end of March, with shipments to continue until 2.1 million vaccines are reached,"" he said.  ""Lebanon has started quick talks with the company to secure more of this vaccine, which has been proven effective by research,"" he  said.  He continued: ""The Ministry of Health had booked two million and 555,000 doses with the Kovacs platform, and the receipt of 1.5 million vaccines from AstraZeneca was finally signed.  As for the Russian vaccine, contrary to what is rumored, we went to the embassy early last September with a book to get the vaccine and secure a donation and negotiations are continuing until now, and the ministry has also begun to study the Chinese vaccine file after completing the documents.""  ""The import of the Russian vaccine through the Ministry of Public Health ensures that sensitive shipping conditions are secured at temperatures below 18 degrees, or through a tripartite agreement that will provide community initiatives with more vaccines,"" he  said.  The minister of health was surprised by the ""continued media confusion over the performance of the Ministry of Public Health, such as the rumor that the Pfizer vaccine will not be handed over to Lebanon for certain political reasons, or that the Ministry of Health was competent in distributing equipment and equipment to hospitals and much more misinformation.""        ""The ministry responds to repeated allegations of compliance with the plans and the serious performance on the ground that reflects the positives of all Lebanese, and the reality is that pfizer's vaccine has arrived on its stated dates in Lebanon, and the equipment has been distributed to all hospitals in all regions without discrimination, and international institutions are dealing with confidence and effectiveness with the ministry despite attempts by some to harm this relationship,"" he  said.  ""One year after the pandemic, the public health sector's horizon looks different,"" Hassan  said. This sector has been supported in an orderly, systematic and unprecedented manner in terms of equipping government hospitals with intensive care rooms and state-of-the-art equipment and equipment. ""These hospitals have won the confidence of the Lebanese in their various segments and classes."""

According to the arrangement, 50 per cent of the students at each school attend the class for one week and get access to distance schooling the following week.    An education system blending class attendance and online learning will continue to be applied alternately. Text messages have been sent to parents including health directives, school schedules and timetables for online learning, Al Sharq newspaper reported today, quoting school officials. As part of precautions against the virus, students attending classes are required to wear protective face masks, and observe distancing of at least 1.5 metres between each other while more gates are designated for school entry to avoid crowding.   /web/20210209123958/https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/qatar/covid-19-students-partially-return-to-schools-in-qatar-1.76245331"

Older people   Evidence from both here in Qatar and around the world clearly shows that the risk of developing severe complications due to COVID-19 increases with age.

Healthcare workers, especially doctors, nurses and paramedics working directly with COVID-19 patients, have an increased risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and catching the virus and becoming sick.
