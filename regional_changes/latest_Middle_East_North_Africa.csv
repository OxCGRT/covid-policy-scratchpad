Government policy is responding to both shocks.    The first case of COVID-19 in Algeria was reported on February 25, 2020. The authorities responded to the pandemic by implementing containment measures since early February 2020 (e.g., cancelling flights, and imposing quarantines to repatriated Algerians). Confinement measures included closure of schools, universities, restaurants, and shops; cancellation of public and private events; shut down of transportation services (internal and external); putting on mandatory leave half of civil servants and private workers with full compensation. Demonstrations and religious activities were cancelled, a lockdown of affected areas was ordered and a curfew was put in place in several cities including Algiers.    A gradual easing of containment measured started in early June 2020. The authorities have continued to monitor and adapt the lockdown measures as needed, including during the second wave of the pandemic in Algeria in late 2020. International borders partially reopened in June 2021. The number of daily new cases, which had fallen sharply through late March 2021 following a peak during the second wave, is ticking up again. Algeria started the vaccination campaign in late-January 2021 and has since received additional doses through the COVAX Facility and other sources for a total of 2.7 million doses as at end-May 2021. Domestic production of the Sputnik V vaccine is expected to start in September, according to an official government announcement.      Key Policy Responses as of June 28, 2021    FISCAL  In terms of tax measures, in response to the economic impact on households and enterprises of the lockdown measures in 2020, the authorities postponed the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises. Further contractual deadlines were relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts were suspended. Imports of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment used in the fight against Covid-19 were temporarily exonerated from VAT and custom duties.    The 2021 budget law introduced a permanent tax holiday for foreign-currency-generating export activities and suspended VAT and custom duties for imported or domestically purchased inputs used in the production of goods. It also extended the repayment period of overdue tax claims to 60 months from 36 months previously,    In terms of spending measures, a supplementary finance law (SFL) enacted on June 4, 2020 included provisions amounting to DZD 70 bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this included DZD 3.7 bn for medical supplies, DZD 16.5 bn for bonus payments to health workers, and DZD 8.9 bn for the health sector's development. For the economic impact, the law included DZD 20 bn for allowances to the unemployed and DZD 11.5 bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL envisaged a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law.    The government estimates the total budget cost of spending measures taken in response to the pandemic at DZD 238 bn for 2020 and the first four months of 2021. Of this amount, DZD 99.1bn were in exceptional bonuses to civil servants contributing to the fight against the pandemic, mostly health workers, DZD73bn were in social support measures to low-income households and DZD 22.5bn for vaccine procurement.    In terms of economic reforms, a national socio-economic recovery plan was discussed at a conference in August 2020. The authorities published a 2020-2024 Economic Revival plan in June 2021. Among other things the plan aims at diversifying the economy, fostering high value-added sectors and international trade and promoting a favorable business climate and FDI.    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL   On March 15, the Bank of Algeria lowered the reserve requirement ratio from 10 percent to 8 percent, and its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.    On April 6, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was easing solvency, liquidity and NPLs ratios for banks. Banks are also allowed to extend payments of some loans without a need to provision against them.    On April 30, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was cutting its main policy rate from 3.25 to 3.00 percent, that it was lowering its reserve requirement ratio from 8 percent to 6 percent, and that it was lowering haircuts on government securities used in refinancing operations.

A ban on travel from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe is in place until further notice. Kuwaiti citizens returning from these countries will be subject to a seven-day mandatory quarantine.
