By law, you must notify the Ministry of Health that you are entering quarantine through the online form or by calling the Ministry of Health hotline at *5400.    In early August, the Israel Defense Forces was formally tasked with “cutting the chain of infections” for the country — finding and testing those suspected of having contracted the disease and putting them into quarantine. This included taking responsibility for the country’s testing efforts and conducting epidemiological surveys: the practice of speaking with confirmed carriers to retrace their steps in the days following their infection to identify and warn those they may have unwittingly passed the disease on to.  Public health experts have identified this type of contact tracing as crucial in curbing the spread of the virus, as it allows authorities to locate people who may have contracted the disease before they have a chance to pass it on.    By November 1, the military plans to have over 2,000 soldiers performing contact tracing, at a rate of roughly two investigations per day, according to an officer from the unit, Lt. Col.

Key Policy Responses as of November 5, 2020    FISCAL  A TND 2.5 billion emergency plan ($0.71 billion or 1.8 percent of GDP) was announced on March 21. The package includes delays in the payment of CIT and other taxes and social contributions; VAT exemptions; the acceleration of VAT refund procedures; the rescheduling taxes and custom arrears; and liquidity easing measures for the private sector, in order to limit layoffs and protect the most vulnerable, especially in the informal sector. The plan also includes an expansion of the budget allocation for health expenses and the creation of a TND 100 million fund for public hospitals to purchase equipment. On the social side, the package included cash transfers for low income households and for disabled and homeless people (TND 450 million for three months).

Besides, the government announced a set of financial measures including the creation of investment funds (TND 600 million), a state guarantee for new credits (TND 1,500 million), the activation of a mechanism for the state to cover the difference between the policy rate and the effective interest rate on investment loans (capped at 3 percentage points).
