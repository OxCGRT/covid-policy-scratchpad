Stringent entry restrictions remain in place upon arrival at all airports in the UAE, which may include a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on arrival, a health declaration form, obtaining health insurance with COVID-19 coverage, a mandatory quarantine period for at least 14 days, and follow-up testing before the completion of quarantine. All travelers to the UAE must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result within 96 hours before their departure. Residents returning to Dubai still require approval before traveling. Those returning to other parts of the UAE no longer need approval. All arrivals in Abu Dhabi must wear a tracking bracelet for the duration of their quarantine. Currently, tourist visas are being issued in Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports. Visitors can travel to Abu Dhabi by road but must present a negative PCR test or negative laser blood test with results received within 48 hours before departure. Abu Dhabi residents or visitors from outside the Abu Dhabi Emirates who enter Abu Dhabi and stay for more than four consecutive days or more are required to take an additional PCR test on the fourth day. Those staying in Abu Dhabi for more than eight consecutive days must take an additional PCR test on the eighth day. Other measures in effect in the UAE are included below: If departing from Abu Dhabi to the EU or UK, you will need to have a negative PCR test result taken within 96 hours prior to your departure. Stringent precautionary measures will continue to be enforced in public areas and facilities across the UAE based on guidelines issued by local and federal authorities. Arrivals in Abu Dhabi from countries that authorities consider high risk are likely to be required to quarantine for at least 14 days. These include but are not limited to Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Chile. Additional high-risk countries can be found on the UAE Government website. Most public transportation options have resumed. Authorities could reimpose, extend, further ease, or otherwise amend any restrictions with little-to-no notice depending on disease activity over the coming weeks. https://archive.vn/cAXGN"

Emphasizing that no Iranian vaccine has been yet allowed to enter the human phase so far, he said that “progress is made when the Food and Drug Administration issues a vaccine clinical work permit.”    All vaccines are in the pre-clinical stage and it is hoped that at least 4 vaccines to start phase 3 of the human trial in September 2021, he highlighted.    Now that coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the world and the third phase of clinical trials has passed, the possible side effects are almost certain, and Iran will be aware of the side effects which speeds up the process, he noted, adding, “vaccines produced in Iran are the same as those produced in China, India, the United States, etc.”    Iraj Harirchi, the deputy minister of health, has said that in Iran, 12 groups are making efforts to develop coronavirus vaccine, three of which have passed the animal testing.    Last week, Namaki expressed hope that the country will introduce the home-grown COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 19, 2021).    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215165940/https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/454829/High-hopes-for-COVID-19-vaccine-in-Iran"

The rules you should follow are no longer determined by your nationality or the country from which you are travelling. Instead, there is one set of measures that applies to all people arriving in Tunisia. This is subject to change at short notice. You should confirm the current policies with your airline.    You must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of departure for Tunisia. Children under 12 years old are exempt from this requirement.  You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.  You must download and use the Tunisian government’s ‘track and trace’ application on your mobile phone.  On arrival, you must self-isolate at your place of residence, a government-approved hotel or quarantine centre for 14 days at your own expense. If your visit to Tunisia is for a maximum of 5 days, you are exempt from quarantine, although a PCR test remains compulsory.  The authorities may assess your private accommodation to check whether it is suitable for quarantine. If they deem it unacceptable, you will be required to isolate at a hotel or quarantine centre at your own expense. No further details have been shared.  If you wish to pay for a second PCR test after 7 days, and this comes back negative, you will be permitted to leave quarantine early. See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.    On 16 November, the Tunisian government changed the measures in place to limit the risk of travellers spreading COVID-19 on arrival in Tunisia. The rules you should follow are no longer determined by your nationality or the country from which you are travelling.

If your visit to Tunisia is for a maximum of 5 days, you are exempt from quarantine, although a PCR test remains compulsory.  The authorities may assess your private accommodation to check whether it is suitable for quarantine. If they deem it unacceptable, you will be required to isolate at a hotel or quarantine centre at your own expense. No further details have been shared.  If you wish to pay for a second PCR test after 7 days, and this comes back negative, you will be permitted to leave quarantine early.
