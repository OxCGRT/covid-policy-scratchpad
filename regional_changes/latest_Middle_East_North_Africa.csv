With support from WHO and other partners, Egypt now has the capacity to conduct up to 200,000 tests.

Maintaining effective contact tracing with proper quarantine mechanisms, as well as continuing systematic testing of patients seeking treatment for all acute respiratory infections will ensure that no critical COVID-19 cases are missed.

Last month, the country’s Education Ministry announced increasing the average attendance rate at all public and private schools as well as kindergartens to reach 50 per cent of their overall capacity in the second semester during which students are divided into two groups for alternate attendance. According to the arrangement, 50 per cent of the students at each school attend the class for one week and get access to distance schooling the following week.    An education system blending class attendance and online learning will continue to be applied alternately. Text messages have been sent to parents including health directives, school schedules and timetables for online learning, Al Sharq newspaper reported today, quoting school officials. As part of precautions against the virus, students attending classes are required to wear protective face masks, and observe distancing of at least 1.5 metres between each other while more gates are designated for school entry to avoid crowding.   /web/20210209123958/https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/qatar/covid-19-students-partially-return-to-schools-in-qatar-1.76245331"
