It is widely considered that a best-buy measure to avoid community transmissibility of the disease and prevent the spread of a virus is by proactively finding those at high risk due to potential exposure, notifying them, and quarantining them if necessary.

However, given the magnitude of the pandemic, further capacity is warranted to ensure proper and complete tracing protocols are being followed as the number of positive cases increase over time.
