Under the new directives, all persons travelling to Lebanon must obtain a health pass by registering on the Ministry of Public Healthâs (MOPH) web platform prior to departure. Effective January, 10, all travellers to the country will be required to make an up-front payment of 45,835 LBP for the MOPH PASS using a credit card via the same online platform. Additionally, all travellers above the age of 12 must upload to the MOPH PASS platform a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours prior to arrival in Lebanon. The passenger will subsequently receive a quick response (QR) code which will be scanned by the authorities at Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport to permit entry. All travellers, with exception of children under the age of 12 and members of the United Nation Interim Force in Lebanon, must take a PCR test upon arrival and isolate for 24 hours until the results are available. Persons whose PCR test results are positive will have to contact the COVID-19 hotline to receive further instructions. Individuals who have been fully vaccinated for over two weeks or who posses proof of having contracted and recovered from COVID-19 no more than 90 days before travel are exempt from the on arrival testing requirement.
