The Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, chaired by MK Gilad Kariv (Labor), convened on Thursday and approved the regulations under the new plan that went into effect on Tuesday (November 9). According to the plan, groups of tourists (numbering 5â40 members) who have received two vaccinations will be permitted to enter Israel even if more than six months have passed since the date of the [second] vaccination, if they meet a series of conditions, including the stipulation that the members of the group must come from countries classified by the Ministry of Health as âgreen"" or âyellow.""     The committee also approved regulations easing restrictions on gatherings in open spaces and cancelling the Green Pass requirement in low-risk locations. The regulations, which are due to go into effect on Thursday night at midnight, state that culture, sports and prayer sit-down events numbering up to 1,000 people can be held in open spaces without a Green Pass requirement. In closed halls, the maximum occupancy will increase from 400 to 600 participants, under Green Pass rules. Open-air venues will be permitted to hold outdoor events without occupancy limits, under Green Pass rules.    The Times of Israel reporting on the changes to gathering restrictions  With Israel apparently exiting its fourth wave of coronavirus infection, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz announced Tuesday that they have agreed to end capacity limits on outdoor gatherings, as well as scrapping âGreen Passâ restrictions on some events.    The new regulations are subject to approval by the coronavirus cabinet, which is expected to hold a telephone vote on Tuesday evening. The changes also need the go-ahead from the Knessetâs Constitution, Law and Justice Committee before they can come into effect from Thursday.    According to the Tuesday statement by the premier and health minister, there will no longer be restrictions on the number of participants at outdoor gatherings.    Additionally, it will now be permitted to hold outdoor cultural, sports, or prayer events with up to 1,000 seated participants without requiring that attendees hold a Green Pass. For indoor events, the threshold will be 100 seated participants.    The Green Pass grants access to public venues for those who are either inoculated against the coronavirus, or have recovered from it, or have recently tested negative.
