Stringent entry restrictions remain in place upon arrival at all airports in the UAE, which may include a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on arrival, a health declaration form, obtaining health insurance with COVID-19 coverage, a mandatory quarantine period for at least 14 days, and follow-up testing before the completion of quarantine. All travelers to the UAE must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result within 96 hours before their departure. Residents returning to Dubai still require approval before traveling. Those returning to other parts of the UAE no longer need approval. All arrivals in Abu Dhabi must wear a tracking bracelet for the duration of their quarantine. Currently, tourist visas are being issued in Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports. Visitors can travel to Abu Dhabi by road but must present a negative PCR test or negative laser blood test with results received within 48 hours before departure. Abu Dhabi residents or visitors from outside the Abu Dhabi Emirates who enter Abu Dhabi and stay for more than four consecutive days or more are required to take an additional PCR test on the fourth day. Those staying in Abu Dhabi for more than eight consecutive days must take an additional PCR test on the eighth day. Other measures in effect in the UAE are included below: If departing from Abu Dhabi to the EU or UK, you will need to have a negative PCR test result taken within 96 hours prior to your departure. Stringent precautionary measures will continue to be enforced in public areas and facilities across the UAE based on guidelines issued by local and federal authorities. Arrivals in Abu Dhabi from countries that authorities consider high risk are likely to be required to quarantine for at least 14 days. These include but are not limited to Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Chile. Additional high-risk countries can be found on the UAE Government website. Most public transportation options have resumed. Authorities could reimpose, extend, further ease, or otherwise amend any restrictions with little-to-no notice depending on disease activity over the coming weeks. https://archive.vn/cAXGN"

Emphasizing that no Iranian vaccine has been yet allowed to enter the human phase so far, he said that “progress is made when the Food and Drug Administration issues a vaccine clinical work permit.”    All vaccines are in the pre-clinical stage and it is hoped that at least 4 vaccines to start phase 3 of the human trial in September 2021, he highlighted.    Now that coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the world and the third phase of clinical trials has passed, the possible side effects are almost certain, and Iran will be aware of the side effects which speeds up the process, he noted, adding, “vaccines produced in Iran are the same as those produced in China, India, the United States, etc.”    Iraj Harirchi, the deputy minister of health, has said that in Iran, 12 groups are making efforts to develop coronavirus vaccine, three of which have passed the animal testing.    Last week, Namaki expressed hope that the country will introduce the home-grown COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 19, 2021).    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215165940/https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/454829/High-hopes-for-COVID-19-vaccine-in-Iran"
