Many schools in the UAE have issued renewed advisories cautioning parents and their wards to take all precautionary measures for Covid-19.  This word of caution comes after the countryâs coronavirus cases crossed the 1,000 mark, in a four-month high, on Thursday.      Additionally, institutions have been receiving updated notifications from the Covid Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (CMEC) in private schools and nurseries stipulating guidelines for exam related procedures in case children contract Covid during the ongoing board exams.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220613155106/https://www.khaleejtimes.com/schooling-in-uae/rising-covid-cases-in-uae-schools-issue-fresh-advisories-to-parents-students"

This rule applies to UAE nationals, residents and tourists.      Travellers must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival in Dubai (only if requested) and quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. Passengers who test positive must follow the guidelines issued by Dubai Health Authority.    Passengers arriving in Sharjah must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival.  They must quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. If the result is positive, then the protocols of the UAEâs Ministry of Health and Prevention will apply.    Violating home quarantine procedures would amount to endangering the lives of others and makes the offender liable to a fine of AED 50,000.      https://web.archive.org/web/20220613162351/https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/handling-the-covid-19-outbreak/travelling-amid-covid-19/quarantine-guidelines-for-travellers-to-the-uae"

""We ask you to wear masks in indoor settings, not because it is mandatory â but because it is an act of solidarity.    ""Wearing a mask is not a burden; discomfort is marginal, and helps to overcome the current surge with a minimum number of cases of serious illness and fatalities. We all need to be carefulâtake care of ourselves and the next person.     ""Multiple studies worldwide have shown that wearing face masks indoors significantly reduces the risk of infecting others with COVID-19. It is very important to fit the mask to the face (it must completely cover the mouth and nose, be snug on your face; do not take it off in indoor settings).    ""Although some try to make others doubt the effectiveness of masks, the scientific information concerning their effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19 to others is well-founded and well-established!
