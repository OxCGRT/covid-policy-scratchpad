The Ministry of Education and the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority said school field trips could also be organised as part of the measures.  Both vaccinated and unvaccinated pupils and staff will be able to take part in such trips, providing they have green status on Al Hosn app.  Face masks must be worn in closed spaces and on buses for trips.  Parents can attend the restored events and activities in line with precautionary measures, including wearing face masks in closed spaces and following the Green Pass protocols on Al Hosn app.  ""The updated protocol also requires all university students wishing to enter dorms to conduct a PCR test once every month, or to follow the Green Pass Protocol for vaccinated and unvaccinated students,"" news agency Wam reported.  Under the updates, following the Green Pass Protocol will be mandatory for all visitors of educational establishments, along with pupils aged 16 and above, educational staff and personnel.  Pupils aged under 16 must take a PCR test every month.    https://archive.ph/cUBRc#selection-2611.0-2655.54"

Many schools in the UAE have issued renewed advisories cautioning parents and their wards to take all precautionary measures for Covid-19.  This word of caution comes after the countryâs coronavirus cases crossed the 1,000 mark, in a four-month high, on Thursday.      Additionally, institutions have been receiving updated notifications from the Covid Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (CMEC) in private schools and nurseries stipulating guidelines for exam related procedures in case children contract Covid during the ongoing board exams.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220613155106/https://www.khaleejtimes.com/schooling-in-uae/rising-covid-cases-in-uae-schools-issue-fresh-advisories-to-parents-students"

At a televised media briefing, an official said there had been cases of people with Covid-19 breaching the mandatory 10-day home isolation period.    Any such breach is a criminal offence and will be dealt with robustly.    Dr Taher Al Ameri, spokesman for the National Crisis and Emergency Management Authority, said residents must be vigilant against Covid-19.    Cases rose by 100 per cent in less than a week, while the number of hospital admissions, which was not specified, has increased. Dr Al Ameri said the wearing of masks indoors would be strictly enforced, with Dh3,000 fines for those caught without one.    The validity period of Al Hosn Green Pass app used in Abu Dhabi will also be reduced from Wednesday, June 15. In schools, it will be brought into effect on Monday, June 20.    Previously, a negative PCR result from a vaccinated person would turn the pass green for 30 days. This has been reduced to two weeks.    Dr Al Ameri said many people had stopped wearing masks in enclosed areas and this was contributing to the surge in cases.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220613160503/https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/health/2022/06/13/uae-to-strictly-enforce-mask-wearing-as-al-hosn-green-pass-reduced-to-14-days/?outputType=amp&d=233"

This rule applies to UAE nationals, residents and tourists.      Travellers must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival in Dubai (only if requested) and quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. Passengers who test positive must follow the guidelines issued by Dubai Health Authority.    Passengers arriving in Sharjah must undergo an RT-PCR test to detect COVID-19 on arrival.  They must quarantine themselves until they receive a negative result. If the result is positive, then the protocols of the UAEâs Ministry of Health and Prevention will apply.    Violating home quarantine procedures would amount to endangering the lives of others and makes the offender liable to a fine of AED 50,000.      https://web.archive.org/web/20220613162351/https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/handling-the-covid-19-outbreak/travelling-amid-covid-19/quarantine-guidelines-for-travellers-to-the-uae"
