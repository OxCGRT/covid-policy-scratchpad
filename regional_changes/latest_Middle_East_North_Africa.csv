When to take a COVID-19 test  In addition to cases where a test should be done, there are cases when it is recommended to take a test, especially for those aged 60 and older and for those in at-risk groups, to find out if you were infected and to receive medical treatment in time.    These are the cases where it is recommended to take a COVID-19 test:  1. 72 hours after exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case  If you were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient, it is recommended to take a home test 72 hours after the exposure. In case the result is positive â you must take a PCR test or an authorized antigen test to be considered as confirmed with COVID-19 and later as a recovering case in the Health System.    2. If there are symptoms consistent with COVID-19  If you have fever, cough, or difficulty breathing â it is recommended to take a home COVID-19 test. In case the result is positive â you must take a PCR test or an authorized antigen test to be considered as confirmed and later as recovering case in the Health System.    3. After receiving a borderline-positive PCR test result  It is recommended to take another PCR test or an authorized antigen test within 24 to 72 hours after the first test. If the result is positive â you will be considered as confirmed with COVID-19 and later as a recovering case.
