"41","Algeria","DZA",2022-01-11,"Middle_East_North_Africa","E1: Income support","1G","1G","05/02/22    Algeria has been hit by two shocks in 2020âthe spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both shocks.    The first case of COVID-19 in Algeria was reported on February 25, 2020. The authorities responded to the pandemic by implementing containment measures since early February 2020 (e.g., cancelling flights, and imposing quarantines to repatriated Algerians). Confinement measures included closure of schools, universities, restaurants, and shops; cancellation of public and private events; shut down of transportation services (internal and external); putting on mandatory leave half of civil servants and private workers with full compensation. Demonstrations and religious activities were cancelled, a lockdown of affected areas was ordered and a curfew was put in place in several cities including Algiers.    A gradual easing of containment measured started in early June 2020. The authorities have continued to monitor and adapt the lockdown measures as needed, including during the second wave of the pandemic in Algeria in late 2020. International borders partially reopened in June 2021. The number of daily new cases, which had fallen sharply through late March 2021 following a peak during the second wave, is ticking up again. Algeria started the vaccination campaign in late-January 2021 and has since received additional doses through the COVAX Facility and other sources for a total of 2.7 million doses as at end-May 2021. Domestic production of the Sputnik V vaccine is expected to start in September, according to an official government announcement.      Key Policy Responses as of June 28, 2021    FISCAL  In terms of tax measures, in response to the economic impact on households and enterprises of the lockdown measures in 2020, the authorities postponed the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises. Further contractual deadlines were relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts were suspended. Imports of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment used in the fight against Covid-19 were temporarily exonerated from VAT and custom duties.    The 2021 budget law introduced a permanent tax holiday for foreign-currency-generating export activities and suspended VAT and custom duties for imported or domestically purchased inputs used in the production of goods. It also extended the repayment period of overdue tax claims to 60 months from 36 months previously,    In terms of spending measures, a supplementary finance law (SFL) enacted on June 4, 2020 included provisions amounting to DZD 70 bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this included DZD 3.7 bn for medical supplies, DZD 16.5 bn for bonus payments to health workers, and DZD 8.9 bn for the health sector's development. For the economic impact, the law included DZD 20 bn for allowances to the unemployed and DZD 11.5 bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL envisaged a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law.    The government estimates the total budget cost of spending measures taken in response to the pandemic at DZD 238 bn for 2020 and the first four months of 2021. Of this amount, DZD 99.1bn were in exceptional bonuses to civil servants contributing to the fight against the pandemic, mostly health workers, DZD73bn were in social support measures to low-income households and DZD 22.5bn for vaccine procurement.    In terms of economic reforms, a national socio-economic recovery plan was discussed at a conference in August 2020. The authorities published a 2020-2024 Economic Revival plan in June 2021. Among other things the plan aims at diversifying the economy, fostering high value-added sectors and international trade and promoting a favorable business climate and FDI.    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL   On March 15, the Bank of Algeria lowered the reserve requirement ratio from 10 percent to 8 percent, and its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.    On April 6, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was easing solvency, liquidity and NPLs ratios for banks. Banks are also allowed to extend payments of some loans without a need to provision against them.    On April 30, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was cutting its main policy rate from 3.25 to 3.00 percent, that it was lowering its reserve requirement ratio from 8 percent to 6 percent, and that it was lowering haircuts on government securities used in refinancing operations.    On September 14, the Bank of Algeria announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio from 6 percent to 3 percent and the activation of 1-month open market operations.    On October 14, 2020, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, announced in April 2020, would be extended through the end of the year.    On January 6, 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, first announced in April 2020, would be extended through March 31, 2021. On February 8 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio from 3 percent to 2 percent effective February 15, 2021.    On April 1, 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, first announced in April 2020, would be extended through June 30, 2021.    EXCHANGE RATE AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  The authorities announced several measures to cut the import bill by at least USD 10 bn (6 percent of GDP). Authorities banned exports of several products, including food, medical and hygiene items.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220205223224/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

This fund covers the costs of upgrading medical facilities and support businesses and households impacted by the pandemic. Businesses with less than 500 employees made temporarily idle and experiencing a reduction in turnover of more than 50 percent were authorized to defer social contribution payments until June 30. Their employees who become temporarily unemployed and are registered with the pension fund received 2,000 dirhams a month and were allowed put off debt payments until June 30. In April, 2020 almost 1 million workers from 134,000 companies were eligible to these transfers. Companies and households can also defer income tax payment until September 30, 2020. In addition, the government has decided to accelerate payment to its suppliers to support businesses. The government has extended social transfers to employees temporarily unemployed and further deferred social contribution payments for some sectors (including tourism) until end-March 2021.    The government also took measures to support households working in the informal sector. Householdsâ benefiting from the non-contributory health insurance (RAMED) received a monthly mobile payment of DRH 800-1200 (USD 80-120) from April, depending on householdsâ composition. Other households which do not benefit from RAMED can claim cash support by registering online. In April, 85 percent of eligible households in the informal sectoral were covered. The government postponed the deadline for personal income tax filing from end-April to end-June 2020 and provided a tax exemption for additional compensation paid by firms to employees in the formal sector up to a limit of 50 percent of the average monthly net salary. A decree-law adopted on April 6, 2020 authorizes the government to increase external borrowing beyond the ceiling approved in the 2020 Budget Act.    On August 6,2020 the authorities announced a plan to sustain the economic recovery and employment levels. The plan envisages the mobilization of DRH 120 billion, mainly in the form of credit guarantees to firms and funding for a newly -created âFund for Strategic Investmentâ, which will finance investment projects (including PPPs) and sustain the capital of firms that needs equity injections to develop their business.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211022120614/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#M"
