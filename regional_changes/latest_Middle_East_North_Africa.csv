Emphasizing that no Iranian vaccine has been yet allowed to enter the human phase so far, he said that “progress is made when the Food and Drug Administration issues a vaccine clinical work permit.”    All vaccines are in the pre-clinical stage and it is hoped that at least 4 vaccines to start phase 3 of the human trial in September 2021, he highlighted.    Now that coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the world and the third phase of clinical trials has passed, the possible side effects are almost certain, and Iran will be aware of the side effects which speeds up the process, he noted, adding, “vaccines produced in Iran are the same as those produced in China, India, the United States, etc.”    Iraj Harirchi, the deputy minister of health, has said that in Iran, 12 groups are making efforts to develop coronavirus vaccine, three of which have passed the animal testing.    Last week, Namaki expressed hope that the country will introduce the home-grown COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 19, 2021).    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215165940/https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/454829/High-hopes-for-COVID-19-vaccine-in-Iran"

The Omari border crossing will continue receiving cargo shipments and diplomatic missions. Authorities previously reopened the Nasib-Jaber border crossing with Syria to trade.  International commercial flights have resumed at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM). All travelers entering Jordan must download the AMAN COVID-19 tracking application and complete a Travel Declaration Form, where they will be required to submit personal information and obtain a QR code. Travelers must present proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 no more than five days before their scheduled flight. Travelers are required to test again at their own expense upon arrival in Jordan.
