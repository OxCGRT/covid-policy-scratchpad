In early August, the Israel Defense Forces was formally tasked with “cutting the chain of infections” for the country — finding and testing those suspected of having contracted the disease and putting them into quarantine. This included taking responsibility for the country’s testing efforts and conducting epidemiological surveys: the practice of speaking with confirmed carriers to retrace their steps in the days following their infection to identify and warn those they may have unwittingly passed the disease on to.  Public health experts have identified this type of contact tracing as crucial in curbing the spread of the virus, as it allows authorities to locate people who may have contracted the disease before they have a chance to pass it on.

Accordingly, the new government announced a series of anti-Covid measures, including (1) prohibition of gathering of groups in public/private places (e.g., sports, culture); (2) mandatory mask wearing in public (e.g., transport, workplace); (3) cohort work arrangement and reduced hours for government personnel; (4) targeted confinement or curfew; and (5) increasing the number of treatment beds to 1,200 by end-October.      Key Policy Responses as of November 5, 2020    FISCAL  A TND 2.5 billion emergency plan ($0.71 billion or 1.8 percent of GDP) was announced on March 21. The package includes delays in the payment of CIT and other taxes and social contributions; VAT exemptions; the acceleration of VAT refund procedures; the rescheduling taxes and custom arrears; and liquidity easing measures for the private sector, in order to limit layoffs and protect the most vulnerable, especially in the informal sector. The plan also includes an expansion of the budget allocation for health expenses and the creation of a TND 100 million fund for public hospitals to purchase equipment. On the social side, the package included cash transfers for low income households and for disabled and homeless people (TND 450 million for three months). The plan also includes a support for temporary unemployed because of the COVID-19 shock (TND 300 million).    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The CBT reduced its policy rate in March by 150 bps. On March 20, the CBT announced a package to support the private sector, requesting banks to defer payments on existing loans and suspend any fees for electronic payments and withdrawals. The central bank asked banks to postpone credit reimbursement by employees for a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the net revenue level. Besides, the government announced a set of financial measures including the creation of investment funds (TND 600 million), a state guarantee for new credits (TND 1,500 million), the activation of a mechanism for the state to cover the difference between the policy rate and the effective interest rate on investment loans (capped at 3 percentage points).    On October 5th, 2020, The CBT decided an additional 50 bps cut in the policy rate. Furthermore, The CBT has also decided to extend the deferral of loan repayments for the tourism sector hardly hit by the crisis to September 2021.  https://archive.is/KkSWz"

Accordingly, the new government announced a series of anti-Covid measures, including (1) prohibition of gathering of groups in public/private places (e.g., sports, culture); (2) mandatory mask wearing in public (e.g., transport, workplace); (3) cohort work arrangement and reduced hours for government personnel; (4) targeted confinement or curfew; and (5) increasing the number of treatment beds to 1,200 by end-October.      Key Policy Responses as of November 5, 2020    FISCAL  A TND 2.5 billion emergency plan ($0.71 billion or 1.8 percent of GDP) was announced on March 21. The package includes delays in the payment of CIT and other taxes and social contributions; VAT exemptions; the acceleration of VAT refund procedures; the rescheduling taxes and custom arrears; and liquidity easing measures for the private sector, in order to limit layoffs and protect the most vulnerable, especially in the informal sector. The plan also includes an expansion of the budget allocation for health expenses and the creation of a TND 100 million fund for public hospitals to purchase equipment. On the social side, the package included cash transfers for low income households and for disabled and homeless people (TND 450 million for three months). The plan also includes a support for temporary unemployed because of the COVID-19 shock (TND 300 million).    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The CBT reduced its policy rate in March by 150 bps. On March 20, the CBT announced a package to support the private sector, requesting banks to defer payments on existing loans and suspend any fees for electronic payments and withdrawals. The central bank asked banks to postpone credit reimbursement by employees for a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the net revenue level. Besides, the government announced a set of financial measures including the creation of investment funds (TND 600 million), a state guarantee for new credits (TND 1,500 million), the activation of a mechanism for the state to cover the difference between the policy rate and the effective interest rate on investment loans (capped at 3 percentage points).    On October 5th, 2020, The CBT decided an additional 50 bps cut in the policy rate. Furthermore, The CBT has also decided to extend the deferral of loan repayments for the tourism sector hardly hit by the crisis to September 2021.  https://archive.is/KkSWz"

This includes detention and forced transfers, the establishment of quarantine centres to hold migrants (de facto detention centres that do not follow COVID-19 standard protocols), and the lack of inclusive solutions in the management of the COVID-19 crisis throughout the country. IOM also keeps advocating against quarantine centres for migrants and refugees only, as a measure to avail discriminatory policies of arrest, encampment, or detention.  https://web.archive.org/web/20201130192636/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/IOM_Eastern%20Corridor%20Migrant%20Situation_18112020.pdf"
