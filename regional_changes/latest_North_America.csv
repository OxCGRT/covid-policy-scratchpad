Some post-secondary institutions throughout Canada are offering most classes online or have implemented vaccine mandates for students and staff to enter campus. In most cases, these decisions are set by individual post-secondary institutions rather than dictated or guided by governments. E.g., âOntarioâs top doctor said â¦ that vaccine policies at post-secondary institutions have served their purpose and should be dropped, saying their removal should align with the [1 March] end of the provinceâs vaccine certificate system.
