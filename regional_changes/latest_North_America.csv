[Health Minister] said Ontarians could use the tests as an âadditional toolâ to âconfidently do the things they love, like visiting family, or dining out at their favourite local restaurant.â But a slide deck distributed to reporters outlining the plans â¦ says the tests are intended for those with symptoms and âgenerally not recommendedâ for use by asymptomatic people with no known exposure before a social event. Asked about the contradiction, [Health Minister] responded that the tests should only be used before visiting vulnerable or immunocompromised people â¦ government previously faced criticism for cutting off access to its lab-confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, reserving them for people at highest risk, such as long-term care residents and health workers, as the Omicron wave threatened to overwhelm the system. It has also faced flak for not making rapid tests more widely available.
