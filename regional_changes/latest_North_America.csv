Lateral flow tests (LFTs) have been approved by Health Canada. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) and other rapid tests are increasingly available to some asymptomatic people in some provinces. According to recent newspaper reports: âCritics say some other jurisdictions, both in Canada and abroad, have made it much easier for people to get their hands on rapid tests for free â¦unlike in Ontario, Alberta or B.Câ¦rapid antigen tests â¦ are difficult to access â¦ British Columbia, top doctor â¦ said this week sheâs not sure they are worth itâ. Data show rapid test usage greater in some provinces without free access to rapid testing than in other provinces with free access. In some provinces, free access has not led to high usage perhaps because potential users have to take the initiative to pick up a free rapid test at a distribution centre vs. distribution in schools and workplaces in other provinces. Government of Canada data to end-November show that less than 20% of all 79,746,088 rapid tests distributed to provincial and territorial governments have been used (14,759,881). The Government of Canadaâs Health Minister âsaid Ottawa would provide the provinces and territories with 35 million more rapid COVID-19 tests [almost 1 for every Canadian] even though tests provided to date remain âlargely underutilizedâ. PCR testing of symptomatic individuals remains the standard first-test approach in the majority of cases in addition to being relied upon for final confirmation.

Lateral flow tests (LFTs) have been approved by Health Canada. In her Economic and Fiscal Statement 2021 (14 December), Canadaâs Minister of Finance stated: âAccess to rapid tests is an important tool for breaking paths of transmissionâincluding against emerging variants of concern ... The government proposes to provide $1.7 billion to Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada to continue supporting provinces and territories in securing the rapid testing supplies they need to keep Canadians safe and healthy, including through expanded school and workplace testing programs. This funding would also support the procurement of additional rapid test kits for distribution to Canadians.â  Provinces and territories intend to make lateral flow tests (LFTs) and other rapid tests increasingly available to asymptomatic people. However, Government of Canada data show that less than 20% of all 81,575,467 rapid tests distributed to provincial and territorial governments as well as the military, federal prisons, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and Northern, remote and Indigenous communities have been used (15,509,620). Some provinces are just starting mass distribution of rapid tests and have not yet solved how to get tests to potential users. E.g., in Ontario: âa pop-up site â¦ for rapid tests â¦ ran out in less than half an hour.â âAlbertans would be able to access free take-home COVID-19 rapid antigen testing kits from participating pharmacies in Edmonton, Red Deer and Calgary starting on Friday (Dec. 17). If you're not in those cities, you can access testing kits through Alberta Health Services sitesâ¦Rapid test kits will also be made available at more schools and for vulnerable populations. The kits are intended for people without symptoms of COVID-19.â In Quebec, ârapid tests â¦ are to be distributed to the general public via pharmacies starting Monday [20 Dec.]â PCR testing of symptomatic individuals remains the standard first-test approach in the majority of cases in addition to being relied upon for final confirmation.

This includes â¦ getting tested if symptomatic and/or as recommendedâ. The current policy intent of most provinces and territories is to supplement polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of symptomatic cases with mass availability of lateral flow and other rapid tests. However the caseload wave is frustrating efforts to achieve testing goals: âFaced with a tidal wave of COVID-19 cases, health officials in Alberta and in Montreal are asking residents to rely on rapid home test kits rather than line up for the more reliable PCR lab tests. Alberta axed general access to PCR tests on Thursday, despite the widespread shortage of rapid test kits. The provinceâs Chief Medical Officer of Health â¦ asked those with forthcoming PRC test appointments to cancel them â¦ [and] said the province dialled back PCR access to conserve the more accurate tests for high-risk groups, such health care workers, continuing-care residents, and those who qualify for antibody treatment because of their clinical condition. âAs Omicron is spreading â¦, no one in Canada will be able to maintain PCR testing for every community case with mild symptomsâ â¦ Alberta did not require residents using rapid tests to report a positive result. The province will still track severe outcomes, such as death [and] will also monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 with other tools, such as wastewater dataâ¦Montreal public-health director â¦ said Montrealers who get a positive result from a rapid antigen test â¦ need not undertake another screening to confirm their statusâ¦the local health authority â¦ around Vancouver has begun rationing PCR tests â¦ only people deemed by medical experts to be âat greater risk of severe disease from COVID-19? are being given these tests on site.â See government of Canada and Globe and Mail newspaper websites, archived:    https://web.archive.org/web/20211227131740/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2021/12/statement-from-the-chief-public-health-officer-of-canada-on-december-23-2021.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211227131413/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-alberta-montreal-call-to-scale-back-pcr-lab-testing-as-demand-rises/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211227132009/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-lab-professionals-working-beyond-humanly-possible-to-process/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211227132501/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-provinces-working-to-meet-demand-for-covid-19-testing-as-cases-surge/"
