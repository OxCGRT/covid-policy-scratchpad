Kreidler's order waiving cost-sharing applies to all state-regulated health insurance plans and short-term, limited-duration medical plans. The order on surprise billing applies to both in-state and out-of-state laboratories when a provider orders diagnostic testing for COVID-19.    Also, insurers must continue:        Allowing a one-time early refill for prescription drugs.      Suspending any prior authorization requirement for treatment or testing of COVID-19.      In addition, if an insurer does not have enough medical providers in its network to provide testing or treatment for COVID-19, it must allow enrollees to be treated by another provider within a reasonable distance at no additional cost.    âConsumers are rightly concerned about prevention, testing and possible treatment,â Kreidler said. âMy emergency order provides guidance to health insurers and should help reassure the public that we will take all necessary steps to protect them.â     Kreidler is using powers granted to him following the statewide emergency that Gov. Jay Inslee declared to protect Washington residents against the spread of the coronavirus.

See Washington:   ""Fully vaccinated people are well protected against COVID-19. Gatherings are likely safe between fully vaccinated people. However, everyone over age 2 must wear a mask in public indoor settings regardless of vaccination status. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people should also keep following public health measures like staying 6 feet (2 meters) apart and avoiding crowds.    Please keep in mind that some people may not feel comfortable gathering â even in low-risk settings. Others may not want hugs and handshakes yet. And thatâs ok. Everyone is adjusting to the new normal and we all just want to stay safe and protect our loved ones.  Visits between people who are all fully vaccinated    Fully vaccinated people can visit with each other with reduced risk without wearing masks or physical distancing. This means it is low risk to dine at a restaurant or to have your fully vaccinated friends over to dinner â and low risk to shake hands or give hugs! To reduce the spread of the delta variant, everyone over age 2 must wear a mask in public indoor settings regardless of vaccination status.  Visits between fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people    Visits between fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people from one other household without masks or physical distancing are likely a low risk to those who are vaccinated.    If you are gathering with unvaccinated people from multiple households, or if any unvaccinated people are at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness, then the visit should take place outdoors or indoors with the windows open, and all unvaccinated people over age 2 should wear masks and stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart. This includes gatherings with children under age 5, who hare not yet able to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  Visits between unvaccinated people    Unvaccinated people should keep gatherings small, meet outdoors, wear well-fitted masks, and maintain physical distance (6 feet / 2 meters).  Attending medium- or large-sized gatherings    Gatherings between fully vaccinated people are likely safe. While not required, it's strongly recommended to also wear masks in crowded outdoor settings, like a live performance or sporting event. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people should wear masks at medium or large in-person gatherings. If the gathering is in a public indoor space, then everyone over age 2 must wear masks, regardless of vaccination status.  Attending other gatherings and social activities away from home    The risk of COVID-19 infection during public social activities â like dining indoors at a restaurant or going to the gym â is lower for fully vaccinated people. Fully vaccinated people can gather with each other without masks or physical distancing in private settings or outdoors. Everyone over age 2 must wear a mask in public indoor settings regardless of vaccination status. It is possible that fully vaccinated people may transmit COVID-19 to unvaccinated people (like children under age 5), and wearing masks is an effective way to reduce this spread.    Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people should continue to wear a mask and stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart in all public settings or when visiting with each other.  Travel    The CDC recommends delaying domestic and international travel until you are fully vaccinated. Traveling increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19.    Fully vaccinated people can:        Travel within the U.S. without getting tested for COVID-19 before or after traveling      Travel within the U.S. and internationally without quarantining after travel    It is federally required to continue wearing a mask when traveling, including on planes, trains, buses, and taxis and ride-shares. You should also stay 6 feet (2 meters) from others, avoid crowds, and wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer while traveling to protect those around you. Please follow the rules of the specific airline, bus, train, or other travel company youâre using.
