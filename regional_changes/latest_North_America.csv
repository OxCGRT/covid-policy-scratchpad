Data show rapid test usage greater in some provinces without free access to rapid testing than in other provinces with free access. In some provinces, free access has not led to high usage perhaps because potential users have to take the initiative to pick up a free rapid test at a distribution centre vs. distribution in schools and workplaces in other provinces. Government of Canada data to end-November show that less than 20% of all 79,746,088 rapid tests distributed to provincial and territorial governments have been used (14,759,881).

In her Economic and Fiscal Statement 2021 (14 December), Canadaâs Minister of Finance stated: âAccess to rapid tests is an important tool for breaking paths of transmissionâincluding against emerging variants of concern ... The government proposes to provide $1.7 billion to Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada to continue supporting provinces and territories in securing the rapid testing supplies they need to keep Canadians safe and healthy, including through expanded school and workplace testing programs. This funding would also support the procurement of additional rapid test kits for distribution to Canadians.â  Provinces and territories intend to make lateral flow tests (LFTs) and other rapid tests increasingly available to asymptomatic people. However, Government of Canada data show that less than 20% of all 81,575,467 rapid tests distributed to provincial and territorial governments as well as the military, federal prisons, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and Northern, remote and Indigenous communities have been used (15,509,620). Some provinces are just starting mass distribution of rapid tests and have not yet solved how to get tests to potential users. E.g., in Ontario: âa pop-up site â¦ for rapid tests â¦ ran out in less than half an hour.â âAlbertans would be able to access free take-home COVID-19 rapid antigen testing kits from participating pharmacies in Edmonton, Red Deer and Calgary starting on Friday (Dec. 17). If you're not in those cities, you can access testing kits through Alberta Health Services sitesâ¦Rapid test kits will also be made available at more schools and for vulnerable populations.
