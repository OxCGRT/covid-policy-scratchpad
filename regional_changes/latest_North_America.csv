It's a key public health measure.â Most provinces and territories intend to follow this practice, if conditions and resources permit. However, tracing capacity is not sufficient in most jurisdictions to deal with high case numbers. In most cases, contact tracing responsibility is up to individuals who are symptomatic and/or have tested positive. For example, in Canadaâs most populous province of Ontario: âIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive, tell your close contacts that they have been exposedâ¦ Informing your contact will help stop the spread of the virus. Give them the link to this webpage, ontario.ca/exposed, so they can protect themselves and their contacts.â See Governments of Canada and Ontario websites, archived:  https://web.archive.org/web/20220605105043/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20220606110704/https://covid-19.ontario.ca/exposed"
