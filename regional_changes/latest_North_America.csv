In some regions at some times, asymptomatic individuals have been encouraged to come forward for mass testing during outbreaks, but that practice remains the exception, not the general rule. See Government of Canada website, archived:  https://web.archive.org/web/20210604134024/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing.html",North_America,2,2
Canada,CAN,13-Jun-21,H2: Testing policy,"As of 13 june 2021, PCR testing of symptomatic individuals remains the standard approach throughout Canada. Some lateral flow tests (LFTs) have been approved by Health Canada, but LFTs have not been deployed in any province or territory on a widespread basis as part of standard testing procedure. In the latest data as of 29 May 2021, 21.1 million LFTs have been distributed to provinces, territories and indigenous communities, but only 3.4 million (16%) have been used. 34.8 million laboratory covid tests have been conducted. With LFTs in use on a relatively limited basis and no LFT strategy articulated by Health Canada, the code remains 2 based on PCR testing. In a 12 May 2021 CBC news report: “Both Britain and Germany are providing so-called lateral flow antigen tests for free on a quota basis, encouraging people to pick them up in a pharmacy, test at home and then report their results online or through an app...CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association, said """"We need to get these tests in the community in a way that is easy to use with not a lot of cost or barriers to using them.""""...Lucira [LTF manufacturer] said its tests should be available for Canadians to order online by June for about $75, excluding taxes and delivery charges. At that price point and online distribution model, they are not expected to be a mass-population solution.” Of all Canadian jurisdictions, the Province of Ontario is the one making most use of rapid testing (including LFTs) having advised on 10 May 2021: “Rapid antigen tests are available for screening people with no symptoms (asymptomatic) in: long-term care homes; retirement homes; schools and childcare centres in communities identified by local public health units and school boards; congregate living settings; workplaces without outbreaks in … priority sectors; certain community agencies working in locations identified under Ontario’s High Priority Communities Strategy...Those who test positive on a rapid antigen test must get a follow-up lab-based PCR test immediately (within 24 hours) to confirm the result.” Ontario’s strategy (which is NOT well-publicized) could be described as: lateral flow testing (and other rapid testing) available to asymptomatic people, who meet specific criteria, and all positive LFTs will be followed up by a PCR test. Weighing all information, 2 based on PCR testing of symptomatic individuals still seems to be the most accurate coding for Canada.

Canada,CAN,14-Jun-21,H3: Contact tracing,"As of 14 june 2021, all provinces and territories are doing their best to apply government of Canada guidance that when individuals “test positive for COVID-19, a public health official will ask you questions to collect important information about your symptoms; activities and travel you did before you tested positive; all the people you may have been in close contact with while you were contagious ...contact tracing. It's a key public health measure.” However, in some regions, contact tracing capacity has not always kept up with caseloads. For example, after a recent outbreak of the Delta variant that may have started in a remote mine and then spread across Canada as workers returned home for scheduled breaks: “The Canadian Red Cross is now being brought into Baffinland [mining site] to help with contact tracing”.
