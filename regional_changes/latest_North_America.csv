Parliament invoked the Emergencies Act to end border blockades and other protests by Canadian truck drivers and their supporters against the national governmentâs decision to amend the definition of essential worker to exclude less-than-fully-vaccinated foreign truck drivers from 15 January 2022 and to require unvaccinated Canadian truck drivers re-entering Canada from the USA to meet testing and quarantine requirements. The government of Canada has now declared the emergency to be over and revoked its Emergencies Act powers.

The benefit is only available when a COVID-19 lockdown order is designated for your region.â All Canadians are eligible to receive this national government support when they live in a province, territory or regional health district that meets the definition of being in âlockdownâ. The âCanada Recovery Sickness Benefit [CRSB], a $450-a-week federal subsidy for people who are ill or who need to isolate because of COVID-19 â¦uptake of the program has been weak. Since its introduction in the fall of 2020 there have only been about 820,000 applicants. Canadaâs initial pandemic subsidy for individuals, the Canada Emergency Recovery Benefit (better known as CERB), had about 8.9 million before it ended.â Both CWLB and CRSB benefit levels are less than 50% of pre-crisis average earnings of just over C$1,000/week. (Average weekly earnings excluding overtime increased almost 7% from 2019 to 2020 in part thanks to the reduction in employment in low-wage sectors such as hospitality that were hit harder by the covid crisis.)
