This applies to adults and children ages 10 and up. Children less than 10 years old are exempt from the PCR COVID-19 test.  Residents (including work permit holders) who do not have a pre-departure negative PCR COVID-19 test result must quarantine for eight days after arrival. They will not be tested on day four, but they will be tested on day eight and will be released from quarantine with a day eight negative results. If you did take an RT-PCR COVID-19 test before departure and receive a negative result during your first four days in Bermuda, you will be released from quarantine. You will still have to test on day 4, day 8, and day 14.  The location and time of each of your tests will automatically be booked for you, so please do not book separate appointments.
