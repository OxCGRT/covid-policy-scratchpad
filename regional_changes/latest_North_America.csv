E.g., in the province of British Columbia (BC): âAt this stage in the pandemic, close contacts are not required to self-isolate or take any special measures. Therefore, contact tracing is of limited value except for high-priority settings. Public Health will follow up with COVID-19 close contacts in â¦High priority settingsâ.

"80","Canada","CAN",2022-02-11,"North_America","H3: Contact tracing","1","1","On 11 feb. 2022, government of Canada advises that when individuals âtest positive for COVID-19, a public health official will ask you questions to collect important information about your symptoms; activities and travel you did before you tested positive; all the people you may have been in close contact with while you were contagious ...contact tracing. It's a key public health measure.â Most provinces and territories intend to follow this practice, if conditions and resources permit. However, tracing capacity is not sufficient in many jurisdictions to deal with a surge in cases. E.g., in Canadaâs most populous province, Ontario: âOmicron variant cases spiked in December and January, overwhelming health resources to the point that the province restricted access to tests, scaled back contact tracing effortsâ.
