Depending on the state, contact tracing is led by the state health department and/or by local health departments. All states appear to have some level of contact tracing. Few states report their contact tracing statistics, so it is difficult to gauge the efficacy of contact tracing.     A CDC report published on 22 January 2021 indicated that """"the capacity to conduct timely contact tracing varied among health departments, largely driven by investigators’ caseloads,"""" and suggesting that contact tracing was not comprehensive across the nation.     The number of COVID tests per 100k people may be one proxy for the level of contact tracing (see CDC COVID Data Tracker). Certain states such as Alaska and Massachusetts currently appear to have the highest rate of RT-PCR tests.    Delaware does publish its contact tracing statistics.
