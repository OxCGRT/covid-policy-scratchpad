Many Canadian students cautiously returned to class this fall [of 2021] under strict pandemic protocols, such as mandatory masking and social distancing. As younger kids became eligible for vaccination late last year, it seemed like schools were settling into new routines. That was soon upended by the rampant spread of the Omicron variant, which saw some provinces extend winter breaks or switch to remote learning. Following the winter surge, public health measures were eased, allowing students to ditch their masks and gather together for school events.â Some post-secondary institutions are still requiring masks on campus, offering classes and exams online and/or have implemented vaccine mandates for students and staff to enter campus. However, these decisions are set by individual post-secondary institutions rather than dictated by governments.

Crown corporations and separate agencies will also be asked to suspend vaccine requirements, and the vaccination requirement for supplier personnel accessing federal government workplaces will also be suspended. With the suspension of vaccination requirements, employees placed on unpaid leave may return to work. ...In addition, federally regulated transport sector employers will no longer be required to have mandatory vaccination policies in place for employees.
