United States,USA,30-Mar-21,C2: Workplace closing,"CDC guidance continues to urge protection measures such as mask wearing, physical distancing, and reduced capacity within businesses to limit the spread of Covid-19. At the state level, many states continue to use re-opening frameworks based on Covid-19 prevalence (and some have lifted capacity limits completely). For example, in Colorado counties fall into one of six color-coded levels of risk. Under level green, the least restrictive, most businesses can operate without restrictions. Indoor bars and indoor entertainment venues must limit capacity to 50 percent or 500 people, whichever is smaller. In level-blue counties, restaurants and gyms can operate at 100 percent capacity as long as parties maintain a 6-foot distance from one another. Indoor bars can operate at 25 percent capacity, with a maximum of 75 patrons. Retail stores can operate at 75 percent capacity.    On March 31, 2021, Governor Holcomb of Indiana signed Executive Order 20-9, extending the statewide mask mandate until April 6 and a county-by-county approach to restrictions. After that, the health department will offer a mask advisory and guidance on gatherings, but it will be up to local authorities and businesses to implement restrictions. Under current restrictions, counties designated as red or orange (areas with the highest risk of coronavirus spread) must limit social gatherings to 25 percent of a facility’s capacity. Counties designated as yellow must limit gatherings to 50 percent of a facility’s capacity. Counties designated as blue can operate at full capacity, as long as social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions are followed.     Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards is lifting some restrictions on businesses as of March 31 through Proclamation number 66 JBE 2021. The majority of businesses, including restaurants, bars, gyms and hair salons, no longer have capacity limits.

Depending on the state, contact tracing is led by the state health department and/or by local health departments. All states appear to have some level of contact tracing. Few states report their contact tracing statistics, so it is difficult to gauge the efficacy of contact tracing.     A CDC report published on 22 January 2021 indicated that """"the capacity to conduct timely contact tracing varied among health departments, largely driven by investigators’ caseloads,"""" and suggesting that contact tracing was not comprehensive across the nation.     The number of COVID tests per 100k people may be one proxy for the level of contact tracing (see CDC COVID Data Tracker). Certain states such as Alaska and Massachusetts currently appear to have the highest rate of RT-PCR tests.    Delaware does publish its contact tracing statistics.

United States,USA,07-Apr-21,H3: Contact tracing,"Contact tracing is conducted on a statewide level, and is often further decentralized by county or local health departments or contracted out to private organizations.
