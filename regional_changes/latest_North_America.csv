Knowing you're infected is important to protect your family and the people you encounter. Contact your local health authority for advice about testing if you think you may have COVID-19 (and/or) have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.â Provincial, territorial and local public health agencies follow this guidance to test individuals who report possible symptoms or are possible contacts. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) have been approved by Health Canada. In her Economic and Fiscal Statement 2021 (14 December), Canadaâs Minister of Finance stated: âAccess to rapid tests is an important tool for breaking paths of transmissionâincluding against emerging variants of concern ... The government proposes to provide $1.7 billion to Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada to continue supporting provinces and territories in securing the rapid testing supplies they need to keep Canadians safe and healthy, including through expanded school and workplace testing programs. This funding would also support the procurement of additional rapid test kits for distribution to Canadians.â  Provinces and territories intend to make lateral flow tests (LFTs) and other rapid tests increasingly available to asymptomatic people. However, Government of Canada data show that less than 20% of all 81,575,467 rapid tests distributed to provincial and territorial governments as well as the military, federal prisons, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and Northern, remote and Indigenous communities have been used (15,509,620). Some provinces are just starting mass distribution of rapid tests and have not yet solved how to get tests to potential users. E.g., in Ontario: âa pop-up site â¦ for rapid tests â¦ ran out in less than half an hour.â âAlbertans would be able to access free take-home COVID-19 rapid antigen testing kits from participating pharmacies in Edmonton, Red Deer and Calgary starting on Friday (Dec. 17). If you're not in those cities, you can access testing kits through Alberta Health Services sitesâ¦Rapid test kits will also be made available at more schools and for vulnerable populations. The kits are intended for people without symptoms of COVID-19.â In Quebec, ârapid tests â¦ are to be distributed to the general public via pharmacies starting Monday [20 Dec.]â PCR testing of symptomatic individuals remains the standard first-test approach in the majority of cases in addition to being relied upon for final confirmation.
