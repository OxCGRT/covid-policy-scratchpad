"64","Canada","CAN",2021-10-18,"North_America","H2: Testing policy","2","2","In the province of New Brunswick (NB): âBeginning Monday, Oct. 18, people who are not a positive COVID-19 case will be able to pick up free rapid-test kits which they can administer at home. Public Health has doubled the number of rapid test kits for each pick-up location â¦ to help meet the initial high demand... said chief medical officer of health Russell: âIt is so important that anyone who has a positive result on a rapid test register for a Gold Standard PCR COVID-19 lab testâ¦ Everyone must remember the rapid screening tests are more reliable when completed regularly, for example using a test every other day from a kit of 5 tests.â Anyone who has been directed by Public Health to isolate is not permitted to leave isolation if they receive a negative result from a rapid test kit. They must remain in isolation as instructed. The kits will be available to the public at largeâ. New Brunswick is the first Canadian jurisdiction to promote mass public rapid testing. âThe POCT program in New Brunswick uses the Abbott Panbio Rapid Antigen point of care test (POCT), a Class IV medical device that has been authorized for use by Health Canada...While rapid POCT is easy to use and gives results rapidly, it is not as accurate as traditional lab-based PCR testing, used to diagnose COVID-19. Only a COVID-19 PCR test is considered a diagnostic test.â In other provinces, rapid testing has been deployed in some schools. While lateral flow tests (LFTs) and other rapid tests are increasingly available to some asymptomatic people in some provinces, PCR testing of symptomatic individuals remains the standard first-test approach in the majority of cases in addition to being relied upon for final confirmation.
