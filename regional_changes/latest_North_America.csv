It's a key public health measure.” However, in some regions, contact tracing capacity cannot always keep up with caseloads.

United States,USA,09-May-21,E2: Debt/contract relief,"Government programs  are offering temporary COVID-19 assistance to pay rent, mortgages, and student loans. Food stamps and federal meal programs have also changed their rules to provide extra help during the coronavirus pandemic.    - If you're repaying a U.S. Department of Education-backed student loan, you're receiving forbearance. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, your principal and interest payments have been automatically suspended through at least September 30, 2021.     - If you’ve been affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and you own a single-family home with a federally backed or FHA-insured mortgage, you can request mortgage forbearance, a pause in making mortgage payments.     - If you're out of work or lost income because of the COVID-19 pandemic, you may qualify for rental assistance through your state HUD program. And a federal eviction moratorium from the CDC, extended through June 30, 2021 may help you stay in your home if you can't pay your rent.
