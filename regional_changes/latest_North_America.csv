However, in most parts of Canada, the caseload wave is frustrating efforts to achieve testing aspirations. E.g., in Canadaâs most populous province Ontario: âThe head of Ontarioâs science advisory panel forecasted a COVID-19 âtidal waveâ as waste water monitoring suggests that the province is seeing between 100,000 and 120,000 new infections each day. [just under 1% of Ontarioâs population] Thatâs a far cry from the 4,224 cases officially reported Thursday because of limited PCR testingâ¦Ontario and Quebec are among the provinces that have been reporting artificially low confirmed case counts since restricting access to PCR testing during the first Omicron waveâ¦ rapid antigen tests were hard to come by during the variantâs initial rise â¦Many provinces donât have systems to collect rapid test results, and those that do rely on voluntary reportingâ.
