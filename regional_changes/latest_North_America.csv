Residents (including work permit holders) who do not have a pre-departure negative PCR COVID-19 test result must quarantine for eight days after arrival. They will not be tested on day four, but they will be tested on day eight and will be released from quarantine with a day eight negative results. If you did take an RT-PCR COVID-19 test before departure and receive a negative result during your first four days in Bermuda, you will be released from quarantine. You will still have to test on day 4, day 8, and day 14.  The location and time of each of your tests will automatically be booked for you, so please do not book separate appointments.

""A $600-a-week federal supplement to unemployment benefits, enacted to address the pandemic, stopped at the end of July. That has pulled away a key source of support, not just for the nearly 30 million Americans receiving benefits but also for the broader economy.    âThe status of the financial relief is a huge question mark hanging over the economy,â said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for the career site Glassdoor.    Mr. Trump said Saturday that he was taking executive action to provide unemployed workers with $400 a week in extra payments, on top of their regular state jobless benefits. He did so after talks on a new round of pandemic relief stalled in Congress.    The Senate adjourned on Thursday until early September, and House members had already left Washington. The departures all but end any chance of a quick agreement on sending stimulus checks to American taxpayers, reviving lapsed unemployment benefits and providing billions of dollars for schools, testing, child care, small businesses, and state and local governments.    In the meantime, states are scrambling to figure out how to carry out Mr. Trumpâs plan, with unemployed workers wondering whether the money will arrive in time to prevent lasting financial harm.""    Timeline of implementation is also not clear:    ""Even for those who qualify, it could be weeks or even months before they begin receiving any extra money. States will need to adjust to the new provisions when they are already overwhelmed by unemployment filings.""    ""The program is retroactive to Aug. 1, meaning that workers should eventually receive payments for all of August.
