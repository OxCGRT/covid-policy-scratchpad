Eastern provinces continue with the most extreme version of internal restriction of movement, again with Newfoundland in particular banning all those from outside the East.     https://web.archive.org/web/20201029020109/https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/protection/soe.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20201029015514/https://www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19/travel-restrictions/  https://web.archive.org/web/20201029020125/https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/how-nunavut-has-stayed-coronavirus-free-as-a-second-wave-hits-canada/"
