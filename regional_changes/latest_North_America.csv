"26","Canada","CAN",2020-10-21,"North_America","C1: School closing","2T","2T","Those students below the university level are broadly in school most days. Certain school boards are alternating online days for older students in hotspots like Quebec. Once again, most universities are operating online.     The province of Newfoundland and Labrador's only university, Memorial University, is operating online for example, meaning they have no in person university classes in the province. Although most universities are technically doing this of their own accord, almost every university in Canada is public and funded/deeply connected to their provincial governments. So, while many universities did this of their own accord, I've put T2 because of their strong links to the government, and preemptive action negated a need to pass laws. In short, there is no reason for certain provinces to pass legislation, because these shut downs have already been done, likely in consultation with the provincial governments. The fact stands that there are entire provinces which do not have in person learning at the university level. Hence T2.     The entire decision making process is happening at a very decentralized level, happening in individual universities within distinct provinces. It is not generally closed however, since certain universities are doing in person classes. One example of this is St Xavier University in Nova Scotia (a smaller liberal arts university).
