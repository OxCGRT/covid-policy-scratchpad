However, some provinces and territories continue to require masks and other covid-related health measures in schools â e.g., some Atlantic provinces and Quebec. Some post-secondary institutions throughout Canada are offering classes and exams online or have implemented vaccine mandates for students and staff to enter campus. In most cases, these decisions are set by individual post-secondary institutions rather than dictated or guided by governments. E.g., âOntarioâs top doctor said â¦ that vaccine policies at post-secondary institutions have served their purpose and should be dropped, saying their removal should align with the [1 March] end of the provinceâs vaccine certificate system. But several Ontario universities said they are keeping their vaccination policies in effect.â At Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), Newfoundland and Labradorâs (NLâs) only university and largest post-secondary institution: âStudents, staff and faculty at Memorial must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have an approved accommodation. This requirement aligns with the Government of Newfoundland and Labradorâs Mandatory Vaccination Policy and is subject to change based on changes to the government policy.â In sum, 1T fits vaccinated students with mask and other covid-related health measures still applicable in schools in some jurisdictions and 2T fits for unvaccinated students, who cannot enter the post-secondary MUN campus because MUN âaligns with the Government of Newfoundland and Labradorâs Mandatory Vaccination Policyâ.
