Many Canadian students cautiously returned to class this fall [of 2021] under strict pandemic protocols, such as mandatory masking and social distancing. As younger kids became eligible for vaccination late last year, it seemed like schools were settling into new routines. That was soon upended by the rampant spread of the Omicron variant, which saw some provinces extend winter breaks or switch to remote learning. Following the winter surge, public health measures were eased, allowing students to ditch their masks and gather together for school events.â Some post-secondary institutions are still requiring masks on campus, offering classes and exams online and/or have implemented vaccine mandates for students and staff to enter campus.
