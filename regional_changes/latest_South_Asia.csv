Those who were unable to take the vaccine so far due to unavoidable social or health reasons such as acute illness or being pregnant or breast feeding at the time. We would like to reiterate here that the vaccine is safe for pregnant and lactating women, and many have also come forward until now. Unless specified otherwise by the treating physician, there are no medical conditions that restrict individuals from taking the COVID-19 vaccination. Please note that all eligible individuals who are not vaccinated yet can choose to take the vaccine within October 2021. The government will also arrange vaccines for children below 12 years, as and when the international and national regulatory bodies approve. Announcements will be made accordingly. Should there be major changes in the global COVID-19 vaccine scenario and trend, we will work towards a vaccination campaign for the entire population at a different time. For now, we do not encourage booster doses beyond the second dose, until stronger evidence evolves. We encourage everyone to continue practicing health habits of washing hands, wearing masks and keep away from crowd to avoid potential threats as the pandemic persists with the same risks.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211021230556/https://www.gov.bt/covid19/06-09-21-%f0%9d%90%88%f0%9d%90%a6%f0%9d%90%a9%f0%9d%90%a8%f0%9d%90%ab%f0%9d%90%ad%f0%9d%90%9a%f0%9d%90%a7%f0%9d%90%ad-%f0%9d%90%a7%f0%9d%90%a8%f0%9d%90%ad%f0%9d%90%a2%f0%9d%90%9c%f0%9d%90%9e/"
