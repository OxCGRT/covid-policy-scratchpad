Anyone showing symptoms will be taken to a medical facility. There is also random testing on passengers -- at a rate of 2% of arrivals -- which is done at travelers' expense.  Anyone who tests positive on arrival will be taken to government isolation facilities, along with anyone seated within three rows of them on the airplane, and relevant cabin crew, whether or not they have tested negative. For more information see here.  Anyone showing symptoms will not be allowed to board their flight. Expect thermal screening before boarding.  Before departure, all travelers aged five years and older must upload a self-declaration form on the Air Suvidha Portal. They must also confirm that they will abide by any Covid-19 decisions taken around potential quarantine or testing, and that their declarations are correct.  Since February 14, those vaccinated with WHO-recognized vaccines, or in countries which have agreements of mutual recognition of vaccine certificates with India, have not needed to present a test on arrival. This covers 89 countries, including the US and the UK. You must upload your documentation alongside your self-declaration form.  Those who do not qualify, or who do not have the right documentation, must upload a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure.  You will not be allowed to board your flight if you have not uploaded your documents.  On arrival, quarantine is no longer required. Instead, international passengers are requested to ""self-monitor their health"" for 14 days following their arrival.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220604083055/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/india-travel-covid-19/index.html"
