Domestic travelers must hold negative results of a COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours before departure or vaccination certificates. Unvaccinated domestic travelers without pre-departure test results, as well as all entrants with an overseas travel history in the past 30 days, must take an on-arrival PCR test and quarantine until they receive a negative test result.

Kerala: All arrivals must register online via the Jagratha portal up to 72 hours before travel. Unvaccinated entrants without pre-departure test results must take an on-arrival test and quarantine at home until they test negative or undergo a 14-day home quarantine. Pre-approved domestic travelers leaving the state within seven days are exempt from quarantine. On-arrival testing is limited to symptomatic and randomly selected international travelers. All international entrants are advised to self-monitor their health, submit to symptom surveillance, as well as avoid gatherings and crowded places for seven days from their arrival.
