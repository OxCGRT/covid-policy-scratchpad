"38","India","IND",2022-01-19,"South_Asia","C1: School closing","3G","3G","National overview as of 19 Jan: No nationwide school closure or student vaccine mandate has been imposed by the national govt (âUnion govtâ/âCentreâ). However, several state governments have enacted school closures and other restrictions. While some areas (i.e Tamil Nadu) have enacted vaccine-differentiated restrictions, restrictions in many areas apply regardless of vaccination status.    Coding explanation: Unvaccinated and vaccinated are both coded 3G, to reflect the widespread closures found in at least *29* states/union territories, encompassing several of the most highly-populated regions. Note that vaccine-differentiated policies do exist, but states with such policies (I.e Tamil Nadu) have not yet opened schools for anyone, though it is planned to do so soon (1 Feb, for Tamil Nadu). Therefore, the coding is 3G to reflect how closure for vaccinated and unvaccinated is effectively the same for the time being, due to the same type of restriction (i.e physical closure of schools for everyone regardless of vaccination status).

However, please note that vaccine mandates for students do exist in some states that have reopened, but the strictest situation is coded for.
