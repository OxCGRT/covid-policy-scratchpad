Officials have earlier classified Botswana, Eswatini, Hong Kong, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and South Africa, as category C locations. International travellers with recent travel history to these countries are not able to enter Pakistan. Returning Pakistani citizens from these countries only enter Pakistan in emergency cases. If they allowed to enter they must present a vaccination certificate, show a negative result from a PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure, take a rapid antigen test upon arrival, and quarantine at either their residence or designated facilities.   Travellers arriving by air from other countries must submit a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours before arrival and a health declaration from online or via the Pass Track mobile application within 48 hours before arrival. Official may require passengers to undergo on -arrival rapid antigen testing (RAT). Symptomatic passengers and those who test positive must quarantine at designated sites until additional test returns a negative result. Passengers from category B countries who obtain a negative result from the on-arrival RAT must quarantine at designated facilities for 10 days, and can leave the premises only after getting a negative result from an RT-PCR test. Land border crossings with India and Iran remain closed, except for limited cargo transport. Authorities allow most border crossings with Afghanistan to operate, though Pakistani officials may require Afghan nationals above the age of 12 to produce a negative result from COVID-19 PCR test taken within 96 hours before arrival.

Revised rules mandate inbound passengers to hold proof of completing vaccination if above 18 years old and negative results of a PCR test obtained within 48 hours before departure if older than six years. They must continue to submit a health declaration from online or via the Pass Track mobile application within 48 hours before arrival. Returning Pakistani citizens unable to avail of vaccination due to visa or medical issues, as well as Afghan citizens entering via land borders, are exempt from carrying vaccination certificate. Passengers arriving via direct flights from Europe will undergo an on arrival rapid antigen test (RAT); officials will also administer RAT to 50% of arrivals from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, as well as a random selection of passengers from other countries. Passengers with positive RAT test results must quarantine for 10 days at a government or self-paid facility, those who test positive on the mandatory PCR test on the eighth day must undergo additional quarantine until they return negative result in a PCR test.
