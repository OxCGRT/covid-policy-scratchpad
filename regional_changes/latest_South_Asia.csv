Officials have lifted restrictions on tourist spots, other establishments, private vehicles, and gatherings. Public transport may operate at 75 percent capacity. Domestic travelers must hold negative results of a COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours before departure or vaccination certificates. Unvaccinated domestic travelers without pre-departure test results, as well as all entrants with an overseas travel history in the past 30 days, must take an on-arrival PCR test and quarantine until they receive a negative test result. Additional entry, testing, and quarantine rules are likely to enter tribal areas in the Nicobar Islands.    Andhra Pradesh: The 23:00-05:00 nightly curfew is no longer in place. Outdoor and indoor gatherings are capped at 200 and 100 people, respectively. Domestic arrivals must register online up to 72 hours before travel on the Andhra Pradesh police website. Domestic entrants do not require proof of vaccination or pre-departure testing; officials may direct symptomatic arrivals to undergo testing and/or quarantine based on test results.    Karnataka: Demonstrations are banned; permitted gatherings must be limited to 300 people if outdoors, and 200 people if indoors. Most in-person educational classes have resumed. Most venues, including state government offices, as well as dine-in, some recreational, and most sports facilities, may function at full capacity. Only fully vaccinated people can use dine-in, recreational, religious, and sports venues. Checkpoints and interstate transport curbs are most likely in border areas of Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, and Mysuru districts. Domestic arrivals must register online up to 72 hours before travel. Officials require entrants from Kerala, Goa, and Maharashtra states to provide a vaccine certificate.    Kerala: All arrivals must register online via the Jagratha portal up to 72 hours before travel. Unvaccinated entrants without pre-departure test results must take an on-arrival test and quarantine at home until they test negative or undergo a 14-day home quarantine. Pre-approved domestic travelers leaving the state within seven days are exempt from quarantine. On-arrival testing is limited to symptomatic and randomly selected international travelers. All international entrants are advised to self-monitor their health, submit to symptom surveillance, as well as avoid gatherings and crowded places for seven days from their arrival.    Puducherry: Large public gatherings remain prohibited through March 31, except permitted events such as funerals and weddings. Commercial, educational, and recreational venues, as well as transport services, can operate at full capacity. Retail outlets must ensure employees are vaccinated. Domestic entrants do not require proof of vaccination or pre-departure testing; officials may direct symptomatic arrivals to undergo testing and/or quarantine based on test results.    Tamil Nadu: All in-person educational classes have resumed statewide. Officials have lifted capacity limits on public transport as well as dine-in, grooming, sports, and retail venues.
