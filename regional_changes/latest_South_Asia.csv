However, several state governments have enacted school closures and other restrictions. While some areas (i.e Tamil Nadu) have enacted vaccine-differentiated restrictions, restrictions in many areas apply regardless of vaccination status.    Coding explanation: Unvaccinated and vaccinated are both coded 3G, to reflect the widespread closures found in at least *29* states/union territories, encompassing several of the most highly-populated regions. Note that vaccine-differentiated policies do exist, but states with such policies (I.e Tamil Nadu) have not yet opened schools for anyone, though it is planned to do so soon (1 Feb, for Tamil Nadu). Therefore, the coding is 3G to reflect how closure for vaccinated and unvaccinated is effectively the same for the time being, due to the same type of restriction (i.e physical closure of schools for everyone regardless of vaccination status).

National overview: No uniform nationwide restrictions imposed by the national government, but many state-level measures. As of 1 Feb, a number of states began easing measures and allowing at least some grades to return to school, albeit with Covid-19 precautions such as masking, sanitisation and social distancing rules. In other areas, total or partial closures have continued.     Coding notes: Change from 3G to 3T/3T. As schools in several (but not all) states have reopened on 1 Feb, the school closures have been downgraded from G (general) to T (targeted). Unvaccinated are coded 3T, to reflect existence of vaccine mandates for students in some states that have reopened. Vaccinated are coded 3T, but separately, to reflect other areas where schools and colleges are still physically closed regardless of vaccination status. Coded â3T/3Tâ instead of just â3Tâ precisely because closure for these groups is due to the effects of different policy types. Do note that for vaccine requirements, some areas have allowed students with at least 1 dose to returnâthis is recorded as a vaccine differentiated measure even though it is not the full 2 doses, as it is still a vaccine-based distinction that determines the students' ability to access in-person classes.    1.

Screening:   - Regardless of vaccination status, all travellers must have a negative result on their PCR test no more than 72 hours before departure. Travellers must also complete and submit a declaration form on the Air Suvidha Portal.   - Upon arrival, travellers from ""Countries Specified At Risk"" must take a PCR test and may not leave the airport until they receive their result.  - Travellers who are not from such countries do not ordinarily need to be tested, but PCR tests are carried out on a random sample (2%) of this group.     2. Quarantine: All travellers, regardless of vaccination status and country of origin, must quarantine for 7 days. It is not possible to ""test out"" of quarantine, even if one tests negative on PCR test taken at the airport.     3.
