Rapid antigen testing is not widely used in Nigeria, and it is not recognized by the Nigerian government for travel purposes.  Travelers who arrive with a rapid antigen test may be required to quarantine at a Nigerian government facility.  Free COVID testing for those with symptoms is available from the Nigerian CDC, but results may not be available quickly.  Individuals who require a test for travel must use an approved private test lab, with costs ranging from $75 to $125 per test.  Results are generally available electronically in less than 3 days.  https://archive.vn/fQ9GE"
