Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test. Air passengers with a positive COVID-19 test result will be required to enter isolation at home or in a government facility at their own expense depending on their symptoms. Although quarantine is not required, travelers may have been exposed to COVID-19 during their travels and are encouraged to limit contact with others for 14 days after their trip.
