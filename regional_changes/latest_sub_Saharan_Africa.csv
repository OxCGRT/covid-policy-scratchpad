Nigeria,NGA,27-Apr-21,H7: Vaccination policy,"Despite these assurances, however, doubts persist which may further threaten the vaccination exercise, and possibly thwart the Nigeria’s authority target to vaccinate millions of eligible citizens within the next two years.    Aniette Patrick, journalist, says she thinks the issue of trust is a major challenge for most Nigerians because leadership has been a major challenge and people tend not to trust the system in place despite the campaigns and enlightenment.    “In Nigeria, I guess nonchalant attitude is one thing and lack of trust is another, people feel what the government is giving as vaccines may not be the same thing others are receiving, that is the common man understanding and I think that is the major factor,” she added.    Experts say vaccine hesitancy will not only threaten COVID-19 response but prevent Nigeria from achieving herd immunity.    The Public Relation officer, National Hospital, Abuja Tayo Haastrup reiterated that the Covid 19 response was first launched in National Hospital by the Federal government and on record, the first Doctor in Nigeria to take the vaccination in the center, is from the Hospital with two of their nurses.    Well within the first two weeks, we had a large turnout of people coming to take the vaccination and we created two venues for the vaccination. At the trauma center, we created some rooms there and we also we created another    “I am sure it was because of the awareness and media support within the period that encouraged people to come out for the vaccination but at today, the turnout is decreasing not as populated as it used to be when we started,” he said.    Chief consultant National Hospital, Abuja, Dr Rais Ibrahim, says as a healthcare provider, he has taken the vaccine so he can render his services to Nigerians adding that there is no pain and recommend everyone should get it.    ‘People are always resistant to change and something new but with time people will see the benefit of taking the vaccine so that you protect yourself and by extension protect your family,” he said.    A recent release by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, showed that only1, 043, 737 eligible Nigerians have so far been vaccinated with the first dose.    See: http://web.archive.org/web/20210510185706/https://www.africanews.com/2021/04/24/covid-19-nigerians-hesitant-to-get-vaccinated//",sub_Saharan_Africa,4G,4G
Nigeria,NGA,11-May-21,H7: Vaccination policy,"The FCT Primary Health Care Board (FPHCB) announced the end of the first round of Covid-19 vaccinations on the 14th of May, signalling that Nigeria had ended the first phase of the covid vaccinations which has so far helped reduced Nigeria’s infection rate to less than 50 cases per day, compared to over 500 during the peak of the second wave.    Last week, the federal government gave the green light for the commencement of the administration of the second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines on eligible Nigerians who had received their first shots.    On a visit to a Federal Hospital in Abuja where vaccinations are given, a nurse speaking anonymously disclosed to Nairametrics that the administration of the second dose of vaccinations is expected to commence sometime between the last week of May and the first week of June 2021.    Vaccination rate at the end of the first phase  At the end of the first phase on the 15th of May, 2021, Nigeria had used 89.2% of its first phase proportion, vaccinating 1,794,552 residents, according to the National Primary Health Care Development Agency.    Lagos State recorded the most vaccinations at 279,372, vaccinating 101% of its proportion, with the FCT vaccinating 96% of its proportion at 118,895.    Expectedly, Kogi State, which was one of the last states to resume vaccinations, has only vaccinated 14,401 residents, which is 66% of its first phase proportion.
