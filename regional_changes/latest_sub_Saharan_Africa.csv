"728","Rwanda","RWA",2021-10-02,"sub_Saharan_Africa","C8: International travel controls","1","1","As part of the Government of Rwandaâs measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the following is mandatory upon entry into Rwanda as of 14th October 2021:      All travelers arriving in Rwanda must present a negative COVID-19 certificate. The only accepted test is a SARS-CoV 2 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) performed within 72 hours prior to departure (meaning travelers must be tested and get results within 3 days of their first flight). Other tests, such as Rapid Diagnostics Tests (RDTs), are not accepted. Please note that COVID-19 test is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years.      Fully vaccinated travelers and children below 18 years will no longer be required to quarantine at designated hotels upon arrival but will be required to self-isolate and wait for the results at home or at booked hotel. Arriving travelers must present a valid vaccination certificate showing their full vaccination status to be eligible for this exception.      All travelers arriving in Rwanda must complete the passenger locator form and upload the COVID-19 test certificate and vaccine certificate (if applicable) before heading to the airport. Please see passenger locator form is available via www.rbc.gov.rw.      All travelers who are not vaccinated transiting for more than 12 hours through Rwanda will be screened upon entry and take a second RT-PCR test on arrival. Sample collection will be conducted at the airport upon arrival and passenger will wait for the results at the designated transit hotel. The COVID-19 Test Results for transiting passengers for more than 12 hours will be fast-tracked so that passengers can get the results before their next flight.      All travelers transiting/connecting who are not leaving the airport and are in transit for less than 12 hours will be screened upon entry and not required to take a second test . This is not applicable for passengers transiting by land border. In this case, passengers will be tested using RT-PCR Test and wait for the results at the designated transit hotels before proceeding.  All travelers will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival at the airport   http://web.archive.org/web/20211025092954/https://www.rbc.gov.rw/index.php?id=745"
