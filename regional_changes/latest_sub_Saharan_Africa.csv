THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROLâS DEFINITION  OF âFULLY VACCINATEDâ  Effective March 7, travelers who show proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test upon arrival in Abidjan.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny airport.     Effective March 7, outbound travelers presenting proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test to depart if the destination country does not require a PCR test to enter.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure.   Outbound travelers who must present a negative PCR test due to destination entry requirements and/or traveler vaccination status must complete the Declaration of Air Travel   .  The Declaration of Air Travel includes a QR code with the test results that airport authorities will request at the airport.  This is the only recognized PCR test for outbound travel.  Effective December 7, all inbound air travelers will be subject to mandatory rapid antigen testing upon arrival at Abidjanâs FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport.  The Ivoirian government will recommend PCR testing at a local testing center for individuals whose rapid tests are positive and that they visit the infectious disease treatment services (SMIT) at the University Teaching Hospital for care.  Ivoirian officials monitor new arrivalsâ health status for five days by calling or texting travelersâ mobile phones.  The government will not require any additional tests, regardless of the result.  -Are health screening procedures in place at airports and other ports of entry? Yes  Temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport (FHB) are conducted using thermal cameras and PCR testing is available.

This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

The results are presented at the various entry points in one of the official languages ??of Cameroon, namely French or English.    Case of travelers entering Cameroonian territory    All incoming travellers, aged 5 and over, are systematically tested at the Border Health Posts (PSF). Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:    if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.    Case of travelers leaving Cameroonian territory    The latter must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test less than 3 days old or a negative RDT, depending on the requirements of the country of arrival or transit.
