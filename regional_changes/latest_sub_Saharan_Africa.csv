At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport must quarantine at a government-monitored hotel for 14 days. These requirements are regularly evolving.  Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20210102114300/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/entry-requirements"

No other sectors are closed according to this proclamation, however there are restrictions on the number of people allowed in certain businesses. There have been no changes since this declaration, however it does not seem to be respected by other officials in Liberia, nor does it seem respected by the public.    After the President extended March's [2] State of Emergency and official restrictions to July 21st [3], he then allowed the State of Emergency to expire [4]. At that time he said that the Minister of Health should ""scrupulously utilize the public health laws going forward as the guiding tool for curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the country"" (Public Health Laws [5]). These public health laws have been in place for decades, and apply even when there is not an active epidemic. Chapter 14 essentially gives the health minister the power to make restrictions after declaring an area ""infected"".    Two days after the President allowed the National Emergency to expire,  on July 23rd, the Ministry of Health published the ""Revised COVID-19 declaration of national health emergency"" [1]. This declaration proclaims the entirety of Liberia as an infected area, and so under the Public Health laws, the health minister *does* have the power to make these restrictions, and enforce them with fines. However, The President has not publicly acknowledged this declaration, and there is no reference to the restrictions on the Government's COVID-19 website [6] after July.

There also were regular situation reports, but those were stopped being posted after May. There do not seem to be any more recent updates.   https://archive.vn/EB6Bk    Given this, there does not appear to be any COVID-19 public information campaign at this time or indeed from June onwards.
