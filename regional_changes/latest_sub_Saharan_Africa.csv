Yes  If so, are test results reliably available within 72 hours? No  Antigen (rapid) tests are available at the international airports and major land border crossings. PCR tests are available for U.S. citizens at two locations: Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital and Diagnofirm Medical Laboratories, both in Gaborone.  Teaching Hospital PCR tests are 500 BWP and results can be slower than 48-72 hours as this is the main testing facility for everyone in country and is cheaper than Diagnofirm. Diagnofirm offers PCR tests for 999 BWP which are available in less than 24 hours. Antigen test costs range from 150 to 500 BWP. All testing is paid for by the patient. The Teaching Hospital price of 500 BWP is a price limit set by the Government of Botswana and is therefore partially subsidized.  Test results are delivered by text message/SMS. Expect delays in messaging even if the results are complete on time.  Testing regulations and information change frequently. If you are in Botswana and experiencing symptoms, contact your physician and the Government of Botswana COVID hotline at 997 for instructions.

Since mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools reopened on November 7, 2020.

Travelers flying abroad must take the test if the destination country requires it, whereas all passengers arriving in Libreville’s airport must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the airport for posterior tracing. On October 10, a new round of relaxation of the preventive measures have been announced, allowing restaurants and religious centers to resume activity and shortening the night curfew from 10pm till 5am. Such gradual reopening of the economy has been based on a comprehensive-testing strategy with a capability of around 10,000 tests to be performed per day and with the equivalent of more than fifteen percent of the population tested, making the country one with the highest rates of testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa.
