This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:  if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.  Case of travelers leaving Cameroonian territory: Travellers leaving Cameroon must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test less than 3 days old or a negative RDT, depending on the requirements of the country of arrival or transit.  Vaccination against COVID-19 and screening at FSPs: Presentation of the vaccination card does not exempt FSPs from screening for COVID-19. It will therefore be necessary to present a valid test when leaving or entering the national territory or to be screened at the various entry points.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220418221429/https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/covid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"

In the meantime, they have taken measures to support the private sector, including loan guarantees and tax obligations facilities as follows: loan guarantees of up to 50 percent for large companies in all sectors (CVE 1 billion, about â¬9 million); up to 80 percent for companies in the tourism and transport sectors (CVE 1 billion); up to 100 percent for small-and medium-sized enterprises in all sectors (CVE 300 million, â¬2.7 million) and for micro-enterprises in all sectors (CVE 700 million CVE, about â¬6.7 million). Other measures include faster settlement of invoices and VAT refunds, extension of the tax payment period, payment in installments for VAT and other withholding taxes, cancellation of contributions to the Pension Fund for three months, and funding of an emergency plan with CVE 76 million through the reallocation of budgetary appropriations, to cover additional expenses for personnel, training and medical equipment.    For the most vulnerable, mitigating measures are estimated at CVE 2.2 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). They comprise: (i) income compensation to provide financial support to individuals operating in the informal sector; (ii) social inclusion emergency measures for vulnerable people without income; (iii) social inclusion income, with support from the World Bank ; (iv) support to microfinance institutions to support interest-free loans to vulnerable households and; (v) care for the elderly with food assistance and other financial support.    In late March 2020, the central bank decided to loosen the monetary policy stance and to increase liquidity in the banking system. Key measures included a reduction in rates as follows: the policy rate by 125 basis points to 0.25 percent, the minimum reserve requirements from 13 to 10 percent, and the overnight deposit rate by 5 basis points to 0.05 percent; and the setting up at the central bank of a long-term lending instrument for banks. The central bank (BCV) also called on banks to grant a moratorium on loans obligations to borrowers in good standing with their payment record as of end-March 2020.    On April 1, 2020, the authorities introduced a moratorium on insurance payments and loans repayment during April-September 2020 for household, companies, and non-profit associations, as well as the SMEs. The moratorium on loan repayment was extended to December 31, 2020 and will now remain in place until the end of the third quarter of 2021.    The BCV also implemented prudential measures, including the reduction in capital adequacy ratio and provision for banks depending on requests by borrowers to place a moratorium or forbearance on loan repayment for three months.    https://archive.ph/WQfEp"
