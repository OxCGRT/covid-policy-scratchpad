In conjunction  with active case finding and testing, and in synergy with other measures such as physical  distancing, contact tracing is recommended in all transmission scenarios.  According to current knowledge, COVID 19 is passed from one person to another primarily  through droplet transmission. People in close contact with COVID-19 cases are at high  risk of being infected with COVID-19, and, if infected, may also transmit the infection to  others. This guideline details how once a COVID-19 case has been identified, the Ministry  of Health and Wellness (MoHW) through District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and  other implementing partners will track, trace and manage people who may have been  exposed to COVID-19.

We will be allowing travel into and out of South Africa for business, leisure and other travel with effect from 1 October 2020.    This is subject to various containment and mitigation measures:    â Travel may be restricted to and from certain countries that have high infection rates. A list of countries will be published based on the latest scientific data.    â Travellers will only be able to use one of the land border posts that have remained operational during the lockdown or one of the three main airports: King Shaka, OR Tambo and Cape Town International Airport.    â On arrival, travellers will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result not older than 72 hours from time of departure.    â Where a traveller has not done a COVID-19 test prior to departure, they will be required to remain in mandatory quarantine at their own cost.    â All travellers will be screened on arrival and those presenting with symptoms will be required to remain in quarantine until a repeat COVID-19 test is conducted.    â All travellers will be asked to install the COVID Alert South Africa mobile app.    Countries that have used this type of app have been able to manage the coronavirus pandemic quite effectively.
