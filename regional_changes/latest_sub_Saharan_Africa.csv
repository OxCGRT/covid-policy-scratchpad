This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

Yes  Eligible unvaccinated travelers over age of 5 years must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test 72 hours before departure. They will also be required to take a rapid antigen test at their own cost ($30) on arrival. Any person who tests positive will have a PCR test administered at their own cost ($50) and self-isolate. Please visit the Kenyan Ministry of Healthâs COVID-19 website  or call the COVID-19 hotline at 719 for updated information.  Travelers who are fully vaccinated are exempted from the PCR test requirement for entry.  There will be no paper verification of COVID-19 test results and vaccination certificates upon arrival into Kenya. Travelers should upload both documents into Global Haven before boarding their flight via globalhaven.org to generate QR codes.  Incoming travelers are required to have a QR code for a completed Travelersâ Health Surveillance Form that they can access from the website https://ears.health.go.ke/airline_registration/ . When they register on the website, the code is sent to their email.  The Kenya Ministry of Health launched the Trusted Travel (TT) Initiative: https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ . At this time, the QR code is for arriving passengers and the TT code is for those departing. Travelers can get the TT code with their test results from an accredited lab at any major hospital.  Due to the rapidly- evolving situation, check with your airlines, transit countries, and final destination on the most updated travel requirements (such as mandatory COVID-19 tests).
