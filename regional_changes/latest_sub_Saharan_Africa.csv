"137","Democratic Republic of Congo","COD",2021-12-14,"sub_Saharan_Africa","E2: Debt/contract relief","2","2","No changes seen  On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The BEAC had also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end-June 2021. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting on March 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program is based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. This program will expire at end-August 2021. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year. At its June 2021 MPC meeting, BEAC decided to adapt liquidity management and start offering long term liquidity absorption operations (one-month maturity) to over liquid banks to help improve monetary policy transmission and the development of the interbank market.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5% to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution. In July 2020, the COBAC prevented all banks from distributing any dividend for the years 2020 and 2021. The COBAC also put in place ad-hoc reporting to closely monitor financial stability developments following the COVID-19 crisis.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211115111052/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
