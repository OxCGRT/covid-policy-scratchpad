How to encourage population's adherence to Covid-19 vaccine in the context of absence or decline in infection cases? This interrogation is Ariane's thread of the work on digital content design and the development of a broadcasting platform (made up of bloggers) that took place in Kribi on the initiative of the Expanded Vaccination Program (PEV) and their partners. Before going into the subject, the vaccine situation as well as studies on prejudice, rumors and controversies about vaccine were exposed.

So itâs actually a confirmatory test for COVID-19. It is important to note that is compulsory only for persons travelling abroad. For every other individual, it is done only when the Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19 is negative and the person still presents with symptoms of COVID-19.  You can no longer get the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for free. On the 2nd of June 2022 the Head of State as per Ordinance number 2022/001, instructed that everyone needing the PCR test for COVID-19 in Cameroon (both travellers and non-travellers), pays the sum of 30,000 fcfa. This was followed by a letter signed by the Minister of Public Health DR Manaouda Malachie,  on the 14th of June 2022, giving practical and transparent steps on the payment process.
