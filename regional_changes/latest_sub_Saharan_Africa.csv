The BEAC had also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end-June 2021. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting on March 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program is based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. This program will expire at end-August 2021. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year. At its June 2021 MPC meeting, BEAC decided to adapt liquidity management and start offering long term liquidity absorption operations (one-month maturity) to over liquid banks to help improve monetary policy transmission and the development of the interbank market.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5% to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution. In July 2020, the COBAC prevented all banks from distributing any dividend for the years 2020 and 2021. The COBAC also put in place ad-hoc reporting to closely monitor financial stability developments following the COVID-19 crisis.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211115111052/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

Travellers entering Zimbabwe by plane must present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours before boarding. Authorities may deny entry to people without a test result or displaying COVID-19 symptoms. Individuals will have to take a PCR test upon arrival at their own expenses (60 US dollars). All travellers entering the country, including returning residents, will have to quarantine at their own cost for 14 days. All passengers are required to complete a COVID-19 contact tracing document on arrival. If travellers present symptoms upon arrival, authorities will detain them until COVID-19 test results are known regardless of a pre-arrival negative test; officials will release affected individuals to self-isolate at their designated address if the test returns negative. Those who test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival must quarantine at a government appointed facility for 10 days.
