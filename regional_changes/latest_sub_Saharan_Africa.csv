Effective March 7, outbound travelers presenting proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test to depart if the destination country does not require a PCR test to enter.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure.   Outbound travelers who must present a negative PCR test due to destination entry requirements and/or traveler vaccination status must complete the Declaration of Air Travel   .  The Declaration of Air Travel includes a QR code with the test results that airport authorities will request at the airport.  This is the only recognized PCR test for outbound travel.  Effective December 7, all inbound air travelers will be subject to mandatory rapid antigen testing upon arrival at Abidjanâs FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport.

This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:  if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.  Case of travelers leaving Cameroonian territory: Travellers leaving Cameroon must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test less than 3 days old or a negative RDT, depending on the requirements of the country of arrival or transit.  Vaccination against COVID-19 and screening at FSPs: Presentation of the vaccination card does not exempt FSPs from screening for COVID-19. It will therefore be necessary to present a valid test when leaving or entering the national territory or to be screened at the various entry points.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220418221429/https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/covid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"

Yes  Eligible unvaccinated travelers over age of 5 years must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test 72 hours before departure. They will also be required to take a rapid antigen test at their own cost ($30) on arrival. Any person who tests positive will have a PCR test administered at their own cost ($50) and self-isolate. Please visit the Kenyan Ministry of Healthâs COVID-19 website  or call the COVID-19 hotline at 719 for updated information.  Travelers who are fully vaccinated are exempted from the PCR test requirement for entry.  There will be no paper verification of COVID-19 test results and vaccination certificates upon arrival into Kenya. Travelers should upload both documents into Global Haven before boarding their flight via globalhaven.org to generate QR codes.  Incoming travelers are required to have a QR code for a completed Travelersâ Health Surveillance Form that they can access from the website https://ears.health.go.ke/airline_registration/ . When they register on the website, the code is sent to their email.  The Kenya Ministry of Health launched the Trusted Travel (TT) Initiative: https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ . At this time, the QR code is for arriving passengers and the TT code is for those departing. Travelers can get the TT code with their test results from an accredited lab at any major hospital.
