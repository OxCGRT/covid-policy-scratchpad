The COVID-19 vaccination campaign covers all 16 prefectures of the country but is experiencing access difficulties due to insecurity and poor road conditions.  The Ministry of Health has revised its national vaccine rollout plan to scale up COVID-19 vaccination with the aim to cover 52 per cent of the total population by December 2022. The plan will include new targets, including people aged 15 and older.   https://web.archive.org/web/20220429101458/https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/car/card/3lzOEAosRF/"

THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROLâS DEFINITION  OF âFULLY VACCINATEDâ  Effective March 7, travelers who show proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test upon arrival in Abidjan.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny airport.     Effective March 7, outbound travelers presenting proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test to depart if the destination country does not require a PCR test to enter.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure.   Outbound travelers who must present a negative PCR test due to destination entry requirements and/or traveler vaccination status must complete the Declaration of Air Travel   .  The Declaration of Air Travel includes a QR code with the test results that airport authorities will request at the airport.  This is the only recognized PCR test for outbound travel.  Effective December 7, all inbound air travelers will be subject to mandatory rapid antigen testing upon arrival at Abidjanâs FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport.  The Ivoirian government will recommend PCR testing at a local testing center for individuals whose rapid tests are positive and that they visit the infectious disease treatment services (SMIT) at the University Teaching Hospital for care.  Ivoirian officials monitor new arrivalsâ health status for five days by calling or texting travelersâ mobile phones.  The government will not require any additional tests, regardless of the result.  -Are health screening procedures in place at airports and other ports of entry? Yes  Temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport (FHB) are conducted using thermal cameras and PCR testing is available.

This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.

Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

Case of travelers entering Cameroonian territory    All incoming travellers, aged 5 and over, are systematically tested at the Border Health Posts (PSF). Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:    if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.

Schools will reopen for the second term on Tuesday next week under strict compliance with Covid-19 prevention and management protocols to ensure a safe environment for learners.  In January, Government came up with a school calendar with 184 learning days following a long break from classes in 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw many outbreaks being reported in schools.  The second term is opening 26 days after schools closed on April 7 and will run for 69 days until August 4.  Speaking at a post-Cabinet briefing yesterday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said learning institutions will open on May 3 as scheduled.  ""The nation is further being informed that the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is currently preparing for the safe reopening of schools on May 3, 2022 in full compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Prevention and Management of Covid-19 as well as other Influenza-like illnesses,"" she said.  http://web.archive.org/web/20220516223139/https://allafrica.com/stories/202204270195.html"
