Antigen tests are available at multiple locations around Gaborone and costs range from 150 to 500 BWP. All testing is paid for by the patient. The Teaching Hospital price of 500 BWP is a price limit set by the Government of Botswana and is therefore partially subsidized.  â¢	Test results are delivered by text message/SMS.
