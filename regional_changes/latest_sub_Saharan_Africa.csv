This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

If the COVID-19 test is negative, passengers will be able to leave quarantine and issued a test certificate, which is valid for 14 days and can be renewed at the end of this period after another test is undertaken.    If a COVID-19 test taken at the airport is positive, then passengers are required to continue self-isolation and await specific instructions from Gabonese health authorities. Visitors to Gabon will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Gabon has nominated for isolation. British nationals resident in Gabon who test positive are required to isolate at home and dial the toll free number 1410 for further instructions.
