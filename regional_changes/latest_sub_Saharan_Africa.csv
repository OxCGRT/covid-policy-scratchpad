The first is to reduce the social and economic impact of COVID-19 on poor and vulnerable households by stabilising household income. The second objective is to support the fight against the pandemic by facilitating compliance with pandemic control measures such as physical distancing.    The COVID-19 ECT builds on the Governmentâs ongoing efforts to support vulnerable households. It does this by providing additional support to households that are already identified as vulnerable and therefore enrolled on the Social Cash Transfer (SCT) programme and by supporting additional households who are vulnerable as a result of the repercussions of COVID-19. The COVID-19 ECT is a temporary initiative that will last for six months    https://web.archive.org/web/20211115173959/https://www.unicef.org/zambia/reports/covid-19-emergency-cash-transfers-brochure"
