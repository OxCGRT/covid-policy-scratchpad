Yes  If so, are test results reliably available within 72 hours? No  Antigen (rapid) tests are available at the international airports and major land border crossings. PCR tests are available for U.S. citizens at two locations: Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital and Diagnofirm Medical Laboratories, both in Gaborone.  Teaching Hospital PCR tests are 500 BWP and results can be slower than 48-72 hours as this is the main testing facility for everyone in country and is cheaper than Diagnofirm. Diagnofirm offers PCR tests for 999 BWP which are available in less than 24 hours. Antigen test costs range from 150 to 500 BWP. All testing is paid for by the patient. The Teaching Hospital price of 500 BWP is a price limit set by the Government of Botswana and is therefore partially subsidized.  Test results are delivered by text message/SMS. Expect delays in messaging even if the results are complete on time.  Testing regulations and information change frequently. If you are in Botswana and experiencing symptoms, contact your physician and the Government of Botswana COVID hotline at 997 for instructions.

The government also plans to allocate additional FCFA 108 billion (USD 194.1 million or 1.2 percent of GDP) as an economic response, including through food stamps, electricity and water subsidies, direct support to SMEs and tax holidays. The Minister of Finance has created a fund available at their Caisse de Depots et Consignation (CDC) and designated a public accountant in order to facilitate disbursements of the health-related spending of that fund. An additional mechanism of around USD 375 million has further been announced to facilitate access to commercial banks financing for private (formal and informal) companies, including SMEs.    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The MPC also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year principal repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution.

Since April 27, some of these measures were relaxed, including the full lockdown in Libreville. A second reopening wave started on July 1 with the reopening of commercial flights twice per week per company from Libreville and a reduced night curfew from 8pm till 5am. Since mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools reopened on November 7, 2020.

Travelers flying abroad must take the test if the destination country requires it, whereas all passengers arriving in Libreville’s airport must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the airport for posterior tracing. On October 10, a new round of relaxation of the preventive measures have been announced, allowing restaurants and religious centers to resume activity and shortening the night curfew from 10pm till 5am. Such gradual reopening of the economy has been based on a comprehensive-testing strategy with a capability of around 10,000 tests to be performed per day and with the equivalent of more than twenty percent of the population tested, making the country one with the highest rates of testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa.

You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.    You will be subject to temperature checks upon arrival.    If you test positive for COVID you will have to isolate in government facilities for 14 days after arrival.    Quarantine requirements  If you arrive in Niger by air with a negative COVID-19 test, you will have to self-isolate at your final destination (home, hotel) for seven days. Government of Niger health teams will visit regularly to ensure compliance. The Nigerien police will retain your passport during the seven-day self-isolation period. On the seventh day of self-isolation you will need to take a second COVID-19 test; if the result is negative you can end self-isolation and if the result is positive you will have to follow government isolation procedures.    If you test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in Niger you will have to isolate in government facilities for 14 days after arrival. All those quarantined are tested for a second time on the 13th day of quarantine.

Key elements are already being implemented, such as food distribution, two months of free utilities to the vulnerable households and temporary tax relief for hard-hit sectors. Finance Ministry also announced credit support to the private sector in the form of loan guarantees. The revised cost includes large-scale support for agricultural production, revenue shortfalls, and the building of liquidity buffers. On May 8, the cabinet approved a supplementary budget with 1.3 percent of GDP in resources re-allocated to additional spending toward health, security and social assistance.

Delivery of test results may be via email, text message (i.e. a PDF send via WhatsApp) or physical copy.  Make sure to confirm a delivery method that suits your needs before selecting a company/lab to conduct the test.  It is recommended  to bring a printed copy of your test results with you to the airport; an electronic copy may not be accepted.
