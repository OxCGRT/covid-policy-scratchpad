Yes  If so, are test results reliably available within 72 hours? No  Antigen (rapid) tests are available at the international airports and major land border crossings. PCR tests are available for U.S. citizens at two locations: Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital and Diagnofirm Medical Laboratories, both in Gaborone.  Teaching Hospital PCR tests are 500 BWP and results can be slower than 48-72 hours as this is the main testing facility for everyone in country and is cheaper than Diagnofirm. Diagnofirm offers PCR tests for 999 BWP which are available in less than 24 hours. Antigen test costs range from 150 to 500 BWP. All testing is paid for by the patient. The Teaching Hospital price of 500 BWP is a price limit set by the Government of Botswana and is therefore partially subsidized.  Test results are delivered by text message/SMS. Expect delays in messaging even if the results are complete on time.  Testing regulations and information change frequently. If you are in Botswana and experiencing symptoms, contact your physician and the Government of Botswana COVID hotline at 997 for instructions.

Since April 27, some of these measures were relaxed, including the full lockdown in Libreville. A second reopening wave started on July 1 with the reopening of commercial flights twice per week per company from Libreville and a reduced night curfew from 8pm till 5am. Since mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools reopened on November 7, 2020. Public gatherings are still not approved. Travelers departing to the countryside from the two main cities (Libreville and Franceville) must show a negative Covid-19 test performed up to five days prior to departure. Since early September, the test for domestic trips can be performed up to 14 days prior to departure. Travelers flying abroad must take the test if the destination country requires it, whereas all passengers arriving in Libreville’s airport must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the airport for posterior tracing. On October 10, a new round of relaxation of the preventive measures have been announced, allowing restaurants and religious centers to resume activity and shortening the night curfew from 10pm till 5am. Such gradual reopening of the economy has been based on a comprehensive-testing strategy with a capability of around 10,000 tests to be performed per day and with the equivalent of more than fifteen percent of the population tested, making the country one with the highest rates of testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa. The Gabonese parliament has also launched at the end of the first semester a Parliamentary Inquire Committee to investigate the quality and transparency of the Covid-19 expenditures by the government.

Guinea began vaccinating against COVID-19 with the Russian Sputnik V vaccine on an experimental basis, starting with government officials, authorities said Thursday.    Guinea has ordered only 55 doses of the Russian vaccine, said Dr. Sakoba Keita, the director-general of the National Health Security Agency.    “We requested a small quantity of the vaccine, 55 doses precisely. This is the beginning of an order,” Keita said. “Yesterday we vaccinated in this pilot phase 25 senior officials of the state. There are 30 doses left and we will continue with the vaccination.”    However, he said on state TV Wednesday that they also sent a letter to Russia requesting 2 million doses of Sputnik V to help the country’s vulnerable. Guinea has a population of 13 million.    Guinea is one of the first African nations to vaccinate its officials.  The Minister of Defense, Mohamed Diane was the first to receive the vaccine. He was shown getting the inoculation on national TV followed by other Cabinet ministers receiving the shots on Wednesday.    Gen. Bourema Condé, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, spoke after receiving the Russian vaccine.    “This new vaccine is a strong signal. This signal shows the strong will of the president. Today is a sampling, and this sampling will be duplicated,” he said. “The president wants all Guineans to be in good health in relation to this pandemic.”    Amadou Damaro Camara, the president of the country’s legislative body, the National Assembly, was also vaccinated.    “We are the guinea pigs,” he said of receiving the first doses of the vaccine.    “It is the government’s permanent concern to want to fight against this disease and we are very happy about it,” he said. “We hope that this vaccination will be extended to the rest of the people and that it will be the beginning of the eradication of this disease.”  Tibou Camara, Guinea’s industry minister, also spoke on the television broadcast after being vaccinated.    “The Guinean population should be congratulated and rejoice at a time when the vaccine is coveted and not very accessible to many countries, and that our country is a beneficiary,” he said.    Russia has businesses in the West African nation and Guinea is known for its bauxite mining.    Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first world leaders to congratulate Guinea’s President Alpha Conde after he won a controversial third term in office after a violently contested election in October.

Quarantine requirements  If you arrive in Niger by air with a negative COVID-19 test, you will have to self-isolate at your final destination (home, hotel) for seven days. Government of Niger health teams will visit regularly to ensure compliance. The Nigerien police will retain your passport during the seven-day self-isolation period. On the seventh day of self-isolation you will need to take a second COVID-19 test; if the result is negative you can end self-isolation and if the result is positive you will have to follow government isolation procedures.    If you test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in Niger you will have to isolate in government facilities for 14 days after arrival. All those quarantined are tested for a second time on the 13th day of quarantine.
