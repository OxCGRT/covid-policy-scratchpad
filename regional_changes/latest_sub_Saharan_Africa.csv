The results are presented at the various entry points in one of the official languages ??of Cameroon, namely French or English.    Case of travelers entering Cameroonian territory    All incoming travellers, aged 5 and over, are systematically tested at the Border Health Posts (PSF). Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:    if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.    Case of travelers leaving Cameroonian territory    The latter must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test less than 3 days old or a negative RDT, depending on the requirements of the country of arrival or transit.

Travellers must present two documents at their point of departure. A verifiable proof of vaccination certificate and a permit to travel certificate, which will be obtained after completion of the pre-boarding health declaration.    From 00:01am on Monday, 4th April, 2022 in-bound passengers to Nigeria who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are no longer required to carry out a COVID-19 PCR test.    Fully vaccinated passengers arriving in Nigeria will not be required to carry out a post arrival PCR test or a rapid antigen test upon arriving in Nigeria.    Proof of vaccination status  On arrival in Nigeria, where applicable you must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated.    Nigeria will accept the UKâs proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You should also carry a printed offline copy. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least two weeks prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.    Nigeria doesnât accept UKâs proof of recovery.    If youâre not fully vaccinated  Prior to departure, all passengers travelling to Nigeria must register and complete the on-line pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal.    Passengers must have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of their departure to Nigeria, and have uploaded their PCR test certificate to the on-line Travel Portal.    Passengers must carry evidence of the test and result when they travel. Only a COVID-19 PCR test is acceptable to the Nigerian authorities. Passengers must also provide a copy of the permit to travel certificate, which will be obtained after completion of the pre-boarding health declaration.    Partially or unvaccinated passengers must also book and pay for a repeat PCR test for day 2 of their arrival and a day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test. Evidence of test booking will be required on arrival. This must be booked through the Nigeria International Travel Portal.    On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria. The Nigerian government has said it will closely monitor whether passengers are following the quarantine measures and conducting the repeat PCR test.    Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated passengers must self-isolate for 7 days on arrival, until they receive a negative COVID-19 test result from their day 7 PCR test.    Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Nigeria on the Nigeria International Travel Portal.    If youâve had COVID-19 in the past year  Entry requirements for Nigeria are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.

"652","Zimbabwe","ZWE",2022-05-18,"sub_Saharan_Africa","E1: Income support","0","0","Temporary food relief: Ongoing food aid distribution was scaled up during the pandemic. Distribution of food aid was constrained and the proportion of households receiving food dropped from 23% in July 2020 to 3% in August-September 2020. In urban areas, only 1% received food aid, or cash transfers to buy food, during this period, thus leaving many families food insecure (World Bank (2021). Zimbabwe Economic Update. Overcoming Economic Challenges, Natural Disasters, and the Pandemic: Social and Economic Impacts. June 2021, Issue 3. The World Bank Group). Â   Social cash transfers: Cash transfers were central in Zimbabweâs Covid-19 social protection response and by 13 October 2020, the government had provided cash transfers to 202,077 beneficiaries (Zimbabweâs cash transfer programme was allocated ZWD 2.4 billion ($6.6 million) by the national stimulus package), throughout the country. However, there was a strong urban bias, with Harare (45%) and Bulawayo (15%) having the highest proportion of beneficiaries. Targeting sought to identify the most vulnerable and was based on the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfareâs databases supplemented by means-testing with lists from the Ministry of Women Affairs, local authorities and informal traders used to identify new beneficiaries.  Challenges centre around coverage and transfer size. Transfers rose from ZWD 180 ($0.49) to ZWD 300 ($0.82), but this was widely considered inadequate, remaining substantially below the Consumer Councilâs reported monthly family basket of ZWD 14,438 ($39.89). In terms of coverage, the proportion of households receiving Covid-19 cash transfers declined from 4% in Round 3 of the Rapid PICES to 1% in Round 4 (ZIMSTAT (2021). Rapid PICES Monitoring Telephone Survey (4th Round) May 2021). This decline was true of both urban and rural areas. Though the reason for the decline remains unclear.   Economic stimulus: In May 2020, the government unveiled a ZWD 18.2 billion ($50.3 million) Covid-19 Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package, valued at 9% of GDP. The aim of the package was twofold. Firstly, it sought to improve the countryâs economic performance and ensure recovery from Covid-19-induced shocks. Secondly, it sought to provide relief to individuals, families and businesses affected by Covid-19. It aimed to reach one million households with relief, including food-deficit mitigation, cash transfers, facilitating and financing healthcare interventions, packages to trigger social welfare, pension support, provision of cushioning allowances, and funding state institutions for Covid-19 research and manufacturing of personal protective equipment. The Government provided ZWD 739 million ($2 million) of the Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package to the Ministry of Health and Child Care to fund various interventions, such as a hiring additional 4,000 health personnel; upgrading of and appropriately equipping all central, provincial and district hospitals and other facilities to accommodate Covid-19 patients; and provision of a tax-free allowance for frontline health workers.   None of the respondents in the Poverty Monitoring Initiative indicated that they had heard of, or received, any benefits under the Covid-19 Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package.   http://web.archive.org/web/20220517052616/https://www.chronicpovertynetwork.org/covid19-poverty-monitor/zimbabwe-march"
"653","Zimbabwe","ZWE",2022-05-18,"sub_Saharan_Africa","E2: Debt/contract relief","0","0","Temporary food relief: Ongoing food aid distribution was scaled up during the pandemic. Distribution of food aid was constrained and the proportion of households receiving food dropped from 23% in July 2020 to 3% in August-September 2020. In urban areas, only 1% received food aid, or cash transfers to buy food, during this period, thus leaving many families food insecure (World Bank (2021). Zimbabwe Economic Update. Overcoming Economic Challenges, Natural Disasters, and the Pandemic: Social and Economic Impacts. June 2021, Issue 3. The World Bank Group). Â   Social cash transfers: Cash transfers were central in Zimbabweâs Covid-19 social protection response and by 13 October 2020, the government had provided cash transfers to 202,077 beneficiaries (Zimbabweâs cash transfer programme was allocated ZWD 2.4 billion ($6.6 million) by the national stimulus package), throughout the country. However, there was a strong urban bias, with Harare (45%) and Bulawayo (15%) having the highest proportion of beneficiaries. Targeting sought to identify the most vulnerable and was based on the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfareâs databases supplemented by means-testing with lists from the Ministry of Women Affairs, local authorities and informal traders used to identify new beneficiaries.  Challenges centre around coverage and transfer size. Transfers rose from ZWD 180 ($0.49) to ZWD 300 ($0.82), but this was widely considered inadequate, remaining substantially below the Consumer Councilâs reported monthly family basket of ZWD 14,438 ($39.89). In terms of coverage, the proportion of households receiving Covid-19 cash transfers declined from 4% in Round 3 of the Rapid PICES to 1% in Round 4 (ZIMSTAT (2021). Rapid PICES Monitoring Telephone Survey (4th Round) May 2021). This decline was true of both urban and rural areas. Though the reason for the decline remains unclear.   Economic stimulus: In May 2020, the government unveiled a ZWD 18.2 billion ($50.3 million) Covid-19 Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package, valued at 9% of GDP. The aim of the package was twofold. Firstly, it sought to improve the countryâs economic performance and ensure recovery from Covid-19-induced shocks. Secondly, it sought to provide relief to individuals, families and businesses affected by Covid-19. It aimed to reach one million households with relief, including food-deficit mitigation, cash transfers, facilitating and financing healthcare interventions, packages to trigger social welfare, pension support, provision of cushioning allowances, and funding state institutions for Covid-19 research and manufacturing of personal protective equipment. The Government provided ZWD 739 million ($2 million) of the Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package to the Ministry of Health and Child Care to fund various interventions, such as a hiring additional 4,000 health personnel; upgrading of and appropriately equipping all central, provincial and district hospitals and other facilities to accommodate Covid-19 patients; and provision of a tax-free allowance for frontline health workers.
