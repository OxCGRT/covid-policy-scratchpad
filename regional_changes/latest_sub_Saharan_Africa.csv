Quarantine requirements  All new arrivals are expected to self-isolate at one location in the city of their arrival until the result of their second PCR test (which should be taken on day 7 of arrival) is known. If the second test is negative individuals can exit self-isolation from day 8 onwards. Anyone that has developed symptoms of coronavirus during their travel or later tests positive will be managed according to national guidelines for COVID-19 treatment.

This is the first time Nigeria will pre-register people for vaccination.    All persons 18 years and above can register for the vaccination through an e-registration portal. The country relies on the media to promote this e-registration under an electronic immunization data management scheme.     The vaccination is then carried out in phases, according to predetermined classifications, Mr. Shuaib says. Frontline health workers are prioritized for the jab so they can safely care for others.    The primary health care agency uses its electronic database to track those who have received the first dose in order to know when they are due for their second dose.
