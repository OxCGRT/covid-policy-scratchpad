How to encourage population's adherence to Covid-19 vaccine in the context of absence or decline in infection cases? This interrogation is Ariane's thread of the work on digital content design and the development of a broadcasting platform (made up of bloggers) that took place in Kribi on the initiative of the Expanded Vaccination Program (PEV) and their partners. Before going into the subject, the vaccine situation as well as studies on prejudice, rumors and controversies about vaccine were exposed.

So itâs actually a confirmatory test for COVID-19. It is important to note that is compulsory only for persons travelling abroad. For every other individual, it is done only when the Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19 is negative and the person still presents with symptoms of COVID-19.  You can no longer get the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for free. On the 2nd of June 2022 the Head of State as per Ordinance number 2022/001, instructed that everyone needing the PCR test for COVID-19 in Cameroon (both travellers and non-travellers), pays the sum of 30,000 fcfa. This was followed by a letter signed by the Minister of Public Health DR Manaouda Malachie,  on the 14th of June 2022, giving practical and transparent steps on the payment process.  However, routine screening in our health facilities using RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic Tests) continues to be free of charge and is part of the immediate response to the Covid 19 pandemic.

Yes  For additional information on COVID-19 related guidelines and measures at Zambian airports, please go here  .  Is a negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) required for entry?  No  Fully vaccinated travelers do not require any form of negative COVID test results but are required to provide proof of full vaccination status. Fully vaccinated means complete doses of a vaccine-for example, first and second doses of a two dose COVID-19 vaccine.  Not fully vaccinated international travelers MUST show proof of a COVD-19 PCR test for a sample collected within 72 hours of departure from the country of origin.  Children below the age of 12 years old are exempt from these measures.  Are health screening procedures in place at airports and other ports of entry?  Yes.  Zambia has implemented limited screening upon arrival at the international airport in Lusaka.  The screening entails completing COVID-19 risk assessment form and may include using no-touch thermometers (âthermo-scannersâ) to check body temperature.   Symptomatic individuals will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and may be asked to submit samples for additional COVID-19 testing.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220709215636/https://zm.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
