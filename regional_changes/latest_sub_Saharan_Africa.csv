Benin,BEN,2021-03-08,H7: Vaccination policy,"One year after the start of the pandemic in Benin, the COVAX initiative shipped 144,000 doses of the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine, licensed by the Serum Institute in India, to Cotonou on March 10, 2021.    This delivery is the first batch received by Benin thanks to the COVAX facility which aims to support the Government's efforts and ensure fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination. In total, 792,000 doses of vaccines will be delivered to Benin through the COVAX initiative by May 2021.    The 144,000 initial doses of vaccines were received at Cardinal Bernadin Gantin International Airport by Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin and members of the COVAX initiative, namely the UNICEF Representative and the WHO Representative, accompanied by the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin.    Benin thus joins the list of African countries that have received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine via the COVAX mechanism. This arrival constitutes a major step forward for Benin in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and a historic moment towards the objective of ensuring an equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the world, within the framework of what constitutes the largest vaccine purchase and supply operation in history.    “Benin is very happy to receive its first vaccines against COVID-19 through the COVAX initiative. Receipt of vaccines marks a turning point in the national response to the pandemic. We are confident that with these vaccines our efforts to protect the population against the virus will be strengthened. However, we must increase awareness so that communities continue to respect barrier gestures, even after the introduction of the vaccine, ”said Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin.    “These vaccines from the COVAX initiative are the result of multilateralism and international cooperation aimed at making the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. An important step remains to be taken, that of mobilizing the population for vaccination. I would therefore like to reiterate the commitment of the United Nations to support the Government to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible, so that no one is left behind, ”said the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin Salvator Niyonzima .    “Vaccination saves lives every year by protecting children from serious illness. With the arrival of vaccines against COVID-19, it is a ray of hope that looms on the horizon because, among the targets to be vaccinated as a priority are those that ensure the right to health and protection for each child. Our thanks also go to all our donor partners who support us on a daily basis in this initiative, ”said UNICEF Representative Djanabou Mahondé.    According to Dr Mamoudou Harouna Djingarey, Acting Resident Representative of WHO, “WHO is delighted with the successful outcome of the negotiations and agreements that have taken place between the various United Nations agencies and international and national partners to provide States with that of Benin, the quantity of vaccines needed to save human lives against COVID-19. This is a historic step in solidarity and the race towards equitable access to anti-COVID-19 vaccines for low-income countries as advocated by the COVAX initiative which is to ensure an equitable distribution of global COVID-19 vaccines ”.    “This is the most ambitious pandemic response initiative in history, and we see an important milestone in our joint efforts now that Benin and other countries in Africa begin to roll out vaccines for their most vulnerable populations, ”said Dr Antoinette Eya Awaga, Country Manager of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. """"To ensure that the pandemic is behind us, we must maintain a sense of urgency and a spirit of partnership so that countries' immunization campaigns are successful, health systems recover and livelihoods be restored ”.    The vaccines transported to Benin with the support of UNICEF come from India. This first batch of vaccines will be administered to 70,000 front-line health workers and the most vulnerable, such as people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities. In total, 20% of the population is expected to benefit from COVAX vaccines.    A shipment of 145,000 syringes and 1,450 safety boxes, from a Gavi-funded stock from UNICEF's regional supply center in Dubai, was received on March 7, 2021.
