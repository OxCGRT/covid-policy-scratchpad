Yes, if not fully vaccinated.  Note â CÃ´te dâIvoireâs definition of âfully vaccinatedâ now includes those who:  received two doses of an approved vaccine within the past nine months, or  received two doses of an approved vaccine, plus a booster shot received within the previous nine months.  THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROLâS DEFINITION  OF âFULLY VACCINATEDâ  Effective March 7, travelers who show proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test upon arrival in Abidjan.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny airport.     Effective March 7, outbound travelers presenting proof that they are fully vaccinated no longer need to present a negative PCR test to depart if the destination country does not require a PCR test to enter.  Those who are not fully vaccinated must present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure.   Outbound travelers who must present a negative PCR test due to destination entry requirements and/or traveler vaccination status must complete the Declaration of Air Travel   .  The Declaration of Air Travel includes a QR code with the test results that airport authorities will request at the airport.  This is the only recognized PCR test for outbound travel.  Effective December 7, all inbound air travelers will be subject to mandatory rapid antigen testing upon arrival at Abidjanâs FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport.  The Ivoirian government will recommend PCR testing at a local testing center for individuals whose rapid tests are positive and that they visit the infectious disease treatment services (SMIT) at the University Teaching Hospital for care.  Ivoirian officials monitor new arrivalsâ health status for five days by calling or texting travelersâ mobile phones.

Yes  Temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers at FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny International Airport (FHB) are conducted using thermal cameras and PCR testing is available.

This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving in Cameroon. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at YaoundÃ© or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.

Travelers should upload both documents into Global Haven before boarding their flight via globalhaven.org to generate QR codes.  Incoming travelers are required to have a QR code for a completed Travelersâ Health Surveillance Form that they can access from the website https://ears.health.go.ke/airline_registration/ . When they register on the website, the code is sent to their email.  The Kenya Ministry of Health launched the Trusted Travel (TT) Initiative: https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ . At this time, the QR code is for arriving passengers and the TT code is for those departing. Travelers can get the TT code with their test results from an accredited lab at any major hospital.  Due to the rapidly- evolving situation, check with your airlines, transit countries, and final destination on the most updated travel requirements (such as mandatory COVID-19 tests).  Is a negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) required for entry? Only for unvaccinated travelers over age of 5 years  Are health screening procedures in place at airports and other ports of entry? Yes  Port Health forms can be found at the Ministry of Health website  or the Jitenge Ministry of Health mobile application. Visitors must scan the QR code from this application on entry.  Travelers are encouraged to complete this in advance as wifi connections may be unreliable upon arrival.  The Government of Kenya established an online portal to extend visitor and resident visas. Please see: https://fns.immigration.go.ke .  Note that the Directorate of Immigration Services has lifted an earlier amnesty on stays in Kenya over the six months stipulated visa period.  Visitors on overstayed visas from September 14, 2020, are required to arrange to depart within 14 days or apply for residency (permit or pass).  Be advised that effective January 1, 2021, all passengers are required to apply and obtain an e-visa before boarding an inbound aircraft to Kenya. The e-visa can be obtained through http://evisa.go.ke/evisa.html .  For more information or questions about this policy, consult the Kenyan Ministry of Healthâs website .                http://web.archive.org/web/20220401174421/https://ke.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
