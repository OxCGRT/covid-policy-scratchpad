Travellers entering Zimbabwe by plane must present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours before boarding. Authorities may deny entry to people without a test result or displaying COVID-19 symptoms. Individuals will have to take a PCR test upon arrival at their own expenses (60 US dollars). All travellers entering the country, including returning residents, will have to quarantine at their own cost for 14 days. All passengers are required to complete a COVID-19 contact tracing document on arrival. If travellers present symptoms upon arrival, authorities will detain them until COVID-19 test results are known regardless of a pre-arrival negative test; officials will release affected individuals to self-isolate at their designated address if the test returns negative. Those who test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival must quarantine at a government appointed facility for 10 days.
