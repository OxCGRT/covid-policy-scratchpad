For every other individual, it is done only when the Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19 is negative and the person still presents with symptoms of COVID-19.  You can no longer get the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for free.

This was followed by a letter signed by the Minister of Public Health DR Manaouda Malachie,  on the 14th of June 2022, giving practical and transparent steps on the payment process.
