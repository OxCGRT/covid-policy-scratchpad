There are no exceptions to this rule even if you are vaccinated, are not exhibiting symptoms, test negative elsewhere, or do not receive your test results in time for your departing flight. You will not be able to leave until you can produce a negative test result from INSP within 72 hours of your scheduled departure and provide proof of your payment for the test. Every traveller arriving in Burundi will no longer be required to undergo a mandatory three-day quarantine. Instead, travellers will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival and must then confine themselves at home or at a hotel of their choice while awaiting the test results, which they will receive within 24 hours of testing.  Those who test positive for COVID-19 will be requested to quarantine at home after obtaining a treatment kit from one of the designated test centers provided by the Ministry of Health.   https://web.archive.org/web/20220307222157/https://bi.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"
