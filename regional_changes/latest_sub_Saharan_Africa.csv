So itâs actually a confirmatory test for COVID-19. It is important to note that is compulsory only for persons travelling abroad. For every other individual, it is done only when the Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19 is negative and the person still presents with symptoms of COVID-19.  You can no longer get the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for free. On the 2nd of June 2022 the Head of State as per Ordinance number 2022/001, instructed that everyone needing the PCR test for COVID-19 in Cameroon (both travellers and non-travellers), pays the sum of 30,000 fcfa. This was followed by a letter signed by the Minister of Public Health DR Manaouda Malachie,  on the 14th of June 2022, giving practical and transparent steps on the payment process.  However, routine screening in our health facilities using RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic Tests) continues to be free of charge and is part of the immediate response to the Covid 19 pandemic.
