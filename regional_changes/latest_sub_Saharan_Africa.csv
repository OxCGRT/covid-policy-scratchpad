The results are presented at the various entry points in one of the official languages ??of Cameroon, namely French or English.    Case of travelers entering Cameroonian territory    All incoming travellers, aged 5 and over, are systematically tested at the Border Health Posts (PSF). Screening at the borders responds to the screening strategies defined by the country. Screening is done using a validated rapid diagnostic test:    if the RDT is positive, the case is considered positive and a second sample will be taken for genomic sequencing (genomic surveillance)  If the RDT is negative, but the case is symptomatic (therefore a suspected case); the patient is taken again for a PCR test.  All confirmed cases must be registered in a linear list and transferred to approved treatment centers. All travelers who test negative are allowed to continue their itinerary.    Case of travelers leaving Cameroonian territory    The latter must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test less than 3 days old or a negative RDT, depending on the requirements of the country of arrival or transit.

"684","Zimbabwe","ZWE",2022-05-18,"sub_Saharan_Africa","E1: Income support","0","0","Temporary food relief: Ongoing food aid distribution was scaled up during the pandemic. Distribution of food aid was constrained and the proportion of households receiving food dropped from 23% in July 2020 to 3% in August-September 2020. In urban areas, only 1% received food aid, or cash transfers to buy food, during this period, thus leaving many families food insecure (World Bank (2021). Zimbabwe Economic Update. Overcoming Economic Challenges, Natural Disasters, and the Pandemic: Social and Economic Impacts. June 2021, Issue 3. The World Bank Group). Â   Social cash transfers: Cash transfers were central in Zimbabweâs Covid-19 social protection response and by 13 October 2020, the government had provided cash transfers to 202,077 beneficiaries (Zimbabweâs cash transfer programme was allocated ZWD 2.4 billion ($6.6 million) by the national stimulus package), throughout the country. However, there was a strong urban bias, with Harare (45%) and Bulawayo (15%) having the highest proportion of beneficiaries. Targeting sought to identify the most vulnerable and was based on the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfareâs databases supplemented by means-testing with lists from the Ministry of Women Affairs, local authorities and informal traders used to identify new beneficiaries.  Challenges centre around coverage and transfer size. Transfers rose from ZWD 180 ($0.49) to ZWD 300 ($0.82), but this was widely considered inadequate, remaining substantially below the Consumer Councilâs reported monthly family basket of ZWD 14,438 ($39.89). In terms of coverage, the proportion of households receiving Covid-19 cash transfers declined from 4% in Round 3 of the Rapid PICES to 1% in Round 4 (ZIMSTAT (2021). Rapid PICES Monitoring Telephone Survey (4th Round) May 2021). This decline was true of both urban and rural areas. Though the reason for the decline remains unclear.   Economic stimulus: In May 2020, the government unveiled a ZWD 18.2 billion ($50.3 million) Covid-19 Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package, valued at 9% of GDP. The aim of the package was twofold. Firstly, it sought to improve the countryâs economic performance and ensure recovery from Covid-19-induced shocks. Secondly, it sought to provide relief to individuals, families and businesses affected by Covid-19. It aimed to reach one million households with relief, including food-deficit mitigation, cash transfers, facilitating and financing healthcare interventions, packages to trigger social welfare, pension support, provision of cushioning allowances, and funding state institutions for Covid-19 research and manufacturing of personal protective equipment. The Government provided ZWD 739 million ($2 million) of the Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package to the Ministry of Health and Child Care to fund various interventions, such as a hiring additional 4,000 health personnel; upgrading of and appropriately equipping all central, provincial and district hospitals and other facilities to accommodate Covid-19 patients; and provision of a tax-free allowance for frontline health workers.   None of the respondents in the Poverty Monitoring Initiative indicated that they had heard of, or received, any benefits under the Covid-19 Economic Recovery and Stimulus Package.   http://web.archive.org/web/20220517052616/https://www.chronicpovertynetwork.org/covid19-poverty-monitor/zimbabwe-march"
