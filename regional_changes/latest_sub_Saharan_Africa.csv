At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.    This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.    Quarantine requirements  If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport must quarantine at a government-monitored hotel for 14 days.

Guinea began vaccinating against COVID-19 with the Russian Sputnik V vaccine on an experimental basis, starting with government officials, authorities said Thursday.    Guinea has ordered only 55 doses of the Russian vaccine, said Dr. Sakoba Keita, the director-general of the National Health Security Agency.    “We requested a small quantity of the vaccine, 55 doses precisely. This is the beginning of an order,” Keita said. “Yesterday we vaccinated in this pilot phase 25 senior officials of the state. There are 30 doses left and we will continue with the vaccination.”    However, he said on state TV Wednesday that they also sent a letter to Russia requesting 2 million doses of Sputnik V to help the country’s vulnerable. Guinea has a population of 13 million.    Guinea is one of the first African nations to vaccinate its officials.  The Minister of Defense, Mohamed Diane was the first to receive the vaccine. He was shown getting the inoculation on national TV followed by other Cabinet ministers receiving the shots on Wednesday.    Gen. Bourema Condé, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, spoke after receiving the Russian vaccine.    “This new vaccine is a strong signal. This signal shows the strong will of the president. Today is a sampling, and this sampling will be duplicated,” he said. “The president wants all Guineans to be in good health in relation to this pandemic.”    Amadou Damaro Camara, the president of the country’s legislative body, the National Assembly, was also vaccinated.    “We are the guinea pigs,” he said of receiving the first doses of the vaccine.    “It is the government’s permanent concern to want to fight against this disease and we are very happy about it,” he said. “We hope that this vaccination will be extended to the rest of the people and that it will be the beginning of the eradication of this disease.”  Tibou Camara, Guinea’s industry minister, also spoke on the television broadcast after being vaccinated.    “The Guinean population should be congratulated and rejoice at a time when the vaccine is coveted and not very accessible to many countries, and that our country is a beneficiary,” he said.    Russia has businesses in the West African nation and Guinea is known for its bauxite mining.    Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first world leaders to congratulate Guinea’s President Alpha Conde after he won a controversial third term in office after a violently contested election in October.

No other sectors are closed according to this proclamation, however there are restrictions on the number of people allowed in certain businesses. There have been no changes since this declaration, however it does not seem to be respected by other officials in Liberia, nor does it seem respected by the public.    After the President extended March's [2] State of Emergency and official restrictions to July 21st [3], he then allowed the State of Emergency to expire [4]. At that time he said that the Minister of Health should ""scrupulously utilize the public health laws going forward as the guiding tool for curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the country"" (Public Health Laws [5]). These public health laws have been in place for decades, and apply even when there is not an active epidemic. Chapter 14 essentially gives the health minister the power to make restrictions after declaring an area ""infected"".    Two days after the President allowed the National Emergency to expire,  on July 23rd, the Ministry of Health published the ""Revised COVID-19 declaration of national health emergency"" [1]. This declaration proclaims the entirety of Liberia as an infected area, and so under the Public Health laws, the health minister *does* have the power to make these restrictions, and enforce them with fines. However, The President has not publicly acknowledged this declaration, and there is no reference to the restrictions on the Government's COVID-19 website [6] after July.     I was unable to determine whether bars and nightclubs are truly closed in Liberia.
