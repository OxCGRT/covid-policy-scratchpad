Botswana is divided into 9 geographical zones (map available at www.gov.bw) and permits are only needed to travel between zones.  Residents may travel within their zone without permits. Permits for inter-zone travel may be acquired online at www.gov.bw and are restricted to essential travel. COVID-19 tests may be required at any time for those transiting zones. Tourism is considered essential travel for economic reasons, and Botswana residents may organize permit applications with a reservation confirmation from their destination lodging.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210208011805/https://bw.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/"

PCR tests are available for U.S. citizens at two locations: Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital and Diagnofirm Medical Laboratories, both in Gaborone.  Teaching Hospital PCR tests are 500 BWP and results can be slower than 48-72 hours as this is the main testing facility for everyone in country and is cheaper than Diagnofirm. Diagnofirm offers PCR tests for 999 BWP which are available in less than 24 hours. Antigen test costs range from 150 to 500 BWP. All testing is paid for by the patient. The Teaching Hospital price of 500 BWP is a price limit set by the Government of Botswana and is therefore partially subsidized.  Test results are delivered by text message/SMS. Expect delays in messaging even if the results are complete on time.  Testing regulations and information change frequently. If you are in Botswana and experiencing symptoms, contact your physician and the Government of Botswana COVID hotline at 997 for instructions.

Since April 27, some of these measures were relaxed, including the full lockdown in Libreville. A second reopening wave started on July 1 with the reopening of commercial flights twice per week per company from Libreville and a reduced night curfew from 8pm till 5am. Since mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools reopened on November 7, 2020. Public gatherings are still not approved. Travelers departing to the countryside from the two main cities (Libreville and Franceville) must show a negative Covid-19 test performed up to five days prior to departure. Since early September, the test for domestic trips can be performed up to 14 days prior to departure. Travelers flying abroad must take the test if the destination country requires it, whereas all passengers arriving in Libreville’s airport must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the airport for posterior tracing. On October 10, a new round of relaxation of the preventive measures have been announced, allowing restaurants and religious centers to resume activity and shortening the night curfew from 10pm till 5am. Such gradual reopening of the economy has been based on a comprehensive-testing strategy with a capability of around 10,000 tests to be performed per day and with the equivalent of more than fifteen percent of the population tested, making the country one with the highest rates of testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa. The Gabonese parliament has also launched at the end of the first semester a Parliamentary Inquire Committee to investigate the quality and transparency of the Covid-19 expenditures by the government. The Ministry of Health is currently preparing a national vaccination strategy against the disease.

The Ministry of Health's Testing Eligibility Tool recommends isolating and monitoring for those with general symptoms, while those with severe symptoms must get in contact with the Ministry of Health to arrange for a test and receive medical attention.    Travelers are expected to cover all costs associated with their COVID-19 test.  Average cost for testing is UGX 350,000. Delivery of test results may be via email, text message (i.e. a PDF send via WhatsApp) or physical copy.  Make sure to confirm a delivery method that suits your needs before selecting a company/lab to conduct the test.  It is recommended  to bring a printed copy of your test results with you to the airport; an electronic copy may not be accepted.
