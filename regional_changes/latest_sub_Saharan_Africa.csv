The variant has many mutations and is therefore expected to show increased ability to cause severe disease, re-infection and possible vaccine resistance compared to other variants of concern.    In line with its mandate, and in light of these developments, The Presidential Taskforce on Coronavirus met on Friday 26th November 2021 to review the status of the pandemic and the adequacy of the measures that are currently in place.    https://web.archive.org/web/20211212020721/https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/situation-coronavirus-pandemic-country-and-review-rules-and-guidelines-context"
