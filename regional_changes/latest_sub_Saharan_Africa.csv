This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon    If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate.

Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr. Mercy Mwangangi Friday, officiated the start of the exercise which included; the roll out of a 10-day mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign targeting to have 2.3 million people vaccinated in at least half of the forty- seven Counties.  The campaign dubbed âKenya Tukae Chonjoâ targets to have anyone above 15 years vaccinated, with emphasis on high risk populations such as frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals and the elderly. Individuals due for the second dose of a two-dose vaccine are also targeted to complete the dose for full vaccination, while those eligible for the booster dose will be vaccinated to enhance immunity. The 10-day vaccination campaign supported by UNICEF, Africa CDC among other partners, will run from the 22nd to 31st of July 2022 in 24 Counties. Currently, the vaccination rate stands at 32% with only five months left to the end of the year. Kenya targets to fully vaccinate at least 70% of its entire adult population by end of December. Vaccines approved for use include; Astrazeneca, Pfizer, Sinopharm, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.
